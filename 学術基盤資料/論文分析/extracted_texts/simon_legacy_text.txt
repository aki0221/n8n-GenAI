ABSTRACT

Herbert Simon's pioneering developments on bounded rationality and artificial intelligence (AI) have had a profound and lasting
impact on public administration. This paper systematically examines Simon's legacy, exploring how his concepts have shaped
scholarship in three core areas: decision-­making, human performance, and organizational knowledge. By connecting Simon's
insights into contemporary advancements in AI, we highlight several avenues for further research. We uncover opportunities
to enhance administrative processes while addressing pressing ethical and operational challenges, such as designing adaptive
frameworks that balance innovation with accountability in public administration. Simon's work continues to offer essential guidance for navigating the complexities of governance in the digital age.

1   |   Introduction
Herbert Simon's groundbreaking work on bounded rationality
has profoundly influenced the field of public administration,
providing a cornerstone for understanding decision-­making processes within complex organizational environments. While the
early foundations of bounded rationality first simmered as a notion in the joint work with Ridley (e.g., Ridley and Simon 1938),
Simon extensively developed the model in Administrative
Behavior (1947) and later formalized the concept in seminal

works from the 1950s, such as his 1955 and 1956 articles (e.g.,
Simon 1955, 1956). Throughout his work, he acknowledged the
cognitive limitations of decision-­makers and the constraints imposed by organizational structures (Fry and Raadschelders 2013;
Ridley and Simon 1938; Sent and Klaes 2005). Simon's critique
of the rational-­comprehensive model, which assumed perfect information and unlimited cognitive capabilities, highlighted the
practical limitations faced by decision-­makers. Instead, Simon
proposed that individuals operate within “bounded rationality,”
arguing that individuals make satisfactory rather than optimal

This paradigm shift not only redefined the theoretical foundations of public administration but also paved the way for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into administrative processes,
leveraging computational models to simulate human decision-­
making (e.g., Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022). In 1956, the
term “artificial intelligence” was coined at the Dartmouth workshop, positing that intelligence could be attributed to living beings and to artificial machines. This marked the beginning of a
new era in computing. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon's development of the “Logic Theorist”—the first program deliberately
engineered to perform automated reasoning—was a pioneering
effort in AI, demonstrating that machines could simulate human
thought processes (Kumar et al. 2024; Nilsson 2009). In recent
years, the intersection of Simon's theoretical contributions and
advancements in AI has garnered significant scholarly attention, emphasizing the relevance of bounded rationality in the
era of digital governance (Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022).
As AI technologies become increasingly embedded in public
administration, it is crucial to reassess the enduring impact of
Simon's work, exploring how contemporary applications of AI
reflect and expand upon his original ideas. For instance, to keep
pace with the rapid advancements in AI, public managers and
scholars must develop effective governance concepts that align
with this dynamic progress; otherwise, related costs of AI might
outweigh its benefits (Wirtz, Weyerer, and Sturm 2020).
Therefore, to systematically assess Simon's legacy, this paper
examines how his enduring concepts have shaped various scientific fields, with a particular focus on public administration.
To set the stage for our investigation, we first revisit the foundational concepts developed by Herbert Simon and his collaborators, which serve as a theoretical cornerstone for understanding
his enduring influence. We then move to our main analyses,
drawing upon a comprehensive review of the literature spanning
the past 50 years. Using the Web of Science (WoS) database, we
performed a targeted search with the query “Simon, Herbert”
in titles, abstracts, and keywords to focus on works that explicitly reference or engage with Simon's contributions, thereby
ensuring alignment with the review's objectives. We then employ a content analysis based on lexical and semantic analyses
(Benoit et al. 2018; Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Goddard 2011;
Nowlin 2016), followed by a latent semantic (LSA) and latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003;
Nowlin 2016). Taken together, these methods enabled us to
identify key articles referencing Simon's work, further evaluating how his concepts and frameworks have been applied both
conceptually and empirically in public administration, as well
as the extent of their integration with AI.
Our systematic review demonstrates that Simon's concept of
bounded rationality remains foundational to understanding
decision-­making within complex organizational environments.
By tracing the evolution of his ideas from administrative theory to AI applications, we highlight their continued relevance
in addressing challenges in public administration. This unified perspective underscores the importance of leveraging
Simon's insights to develop integrative frameworks that enhance decision-­making while navigating the complexities of

AI integration. Following our cluster analysis, we identify
three main topics with the related literature: we coin them as
“Rationality and Decision-­Making” (e.g., Chen 1991; Foss 2003;
Herold 2014; Olsen 2017), “Human Choice and Performance”
(e.g., Arrojo 2017; Jones 2002; Navaneethakrishnan 2021;
Wettersten 2017), and “Work, Organizations, and Knowledge”
(e.g., Barragan 2022; Bertoin 2019; Sarasvathy 2003). Notably,
these studies have highlighted the enduring relevance of Simon's
work in understanding organizational behavior, developing decision support systems, and designing AI-­driven administrative tools (Newell and Simon 1972; Schwarz, Christensen, and
Zhu 2022; Simon 1997).
Interestingly, however, only a few studies published in public
administration outlets in the past year have taken center stage
on these broader topics and debates. Schwoerer et al. (2022),
in their Public Administration article titled “CO-­DESIGN-­ing
a more context-­based, pluralistic, and participatory future for
public administration,” notice that although design science has
a long intellectual history in the field of public administration,
led by Simon's ideas, the field lacks participatory and context-­
based research that should be co-­designed between researchers
and practitioners across fields. Along these lines, recent developments illustrated by a recent Public Administration Review symposium (Al-­Hashimi et al. 2022; Dowding and Taflaga 2022;
Feduzi, Runde, and Schwarz 2022; Hansen and Nielsen 2022;
Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022; van der Voet and
Lems 2022) highlight that the field lacks a better understanding of the interface between public administration and AI. More
recent AI applications in administrative contexts often involve
machine learning algorithms that iteratively improve decision
outcomes based on bounded rational criteria (e.g., Russell and
Norvig 2016). These technologies provide tools for managing
complexity and uncertainty, addressing challenges identified by
Simon, such as information overload and cognitive biases (e.g.,
Bostrom and Yudkowsky 2018).
Finally, our review underscores a limited cross-­
pollination
across fields that should be at least partially explained by the
social acceptance issues and other concerns related to AI in the
public sector (Wirtz, Weyerer, and Sturm 2020). Integrating
AI into public administration presents new opportunities that
should be cautiously debated, therefore advancing Simon's legacy and potentially offering innovative solutions to longstanding
challenges in decision-­making. Future research should focus
on exploring the synergies between bounded rationality and
AI, investigating how AI can enhance the cognitive capacities
of administrators and improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of public sector operations. Additionally, empirical studies are
needed to evaluate the practical impacts of AI-­driven decision-­
making tools. By embracing the advancements and challenges
of AI, public administration can continue to build on Simon's
legacy, fostering a more rational, informed, and effective governance framework.

impact on public administration and AI. Before delving into the

decisions based on the information available and cognitive constraints (e.g., Simon 1955, 1956).

2.1   |   The Evolution of Herbert Simon's Theoretical
Frameworks
The concept of bounded rationality, while not explicitly introduced in 1947, was foreshadowed in Herbert Simon's earlier works and fully developed over the late 1940s and 1950s
(e.g., Simon 1946, 1947, 1955, 1956). This foundational idea
first emerged in joint work with Clarence Ridley, evolved over
decades, and became formalized as a concept in the 1950s
(Fry and Raadschelders 2013; Ridley and Simon 1938; Sent
and Klaes 2005). Simon's critique of the classical rational-­
comprehensive model, which assumed perfect information
and unlimited cognitive capabilities, highlighted the practical
limitations faced by decision-­makers operating within complex
organizational structures. Throughout his work, Simon proposed that individuals make decisions within the constraints
of “bounded rationality.” Individuals would seek satisfactory
rather than optimal solutions based on available information
and cognitive limitations (e.g., Simon 1955, 1956).
However, Administrative Behavior (1947) remains one of
Simon's most influential contributions, laying the foundation
for his lasting legacy. In this seminal work, Simon emphasized
the cognitive and environmental constraints faced by decision-­
makers, offering a groundbreaking and more realistic approach
to understanding administrative behavior (Simon 1947). These
ideas were later formalized in “A Behavioral Model of Rational
Choice” (1955) and “Rational Choice and the Structure of the
Environment” (1956), where Simon introduced the concept of
satisficing as a practical alternative to optimizing in decision-­
making. By bridging economics and psychology, Simon argued
for decision-­making grounded in empirical evidence and systematic analysis, reshaping not only public administration but also
influencing a wide range of disciplines. Despite critiques from
contemporaries who argued for the inclusion of values in public administration (Denhardt and Denhardt 2000; Waldo 1952),
Simon's commitment to empirical research has had a lasting
impact.
Studies of logical positivism and his scientific observations led
Simon to conclude that the rationality of decisions was a central concern of administrative theory (Simon 1997) and that
his procedural rationality should guide government action.
As an antagonist, Simon used the rational/economic man as a
foil—pointing out the absurdities of selecting the only possible

alternative. In contrast, Simon's administrative man was satisficed and sought a course of action that was satisfactory or “good
enough” (Simon 1997). Once stripped of pretensions, the rational
model was the unrealistic result of excessive abstract theorizing
(Jones 1994b, 1994a, 2003). As Simon (1997) wrote, “Rationality
implies a complete, and unattainable, knowledge of the exact
consequences of each choice” (Simon 1997, 94). Simon's contrasting three-­step model retained some elements of rationality
but stopped short of an ideal choice: “(a) viewing the behavior alternatives prior to the decision in panoramic fashion, (b) considering the whole complex of consequences that would follow each
choice, and (c) with the system of values as criterion singling out
one from the whole set of alternatives” (Simon 1997, 93).
The satisficing process remains demanding, indeed, in terms of
patience (what Simon calls docility) and requires rigorous fact-­
finding, development of mental frameworks, communication,
and raw theoretical predictions. Success requires accounting
for “factors regarded as most relevant and crucial” (Simon 1997,
119). Simon anticipates the problems that his rigorous process
presents, and he acknowledges that administrators must frequently make quick, intuitive decisions and that satisfactory
solutions are only sometimes possible. In response, Simon offers
a demystified intuitive decision-­making process, which he links
to memory. Both computers and the human mind retrieve information from memory as needed. Decision-­makers “employ the
same mix of intuition and analysis used in other expert systems”
(Simon 1997, 135), though developing this ability takes experience and training. Decisions based on emotion are the sole exception to the bounded rationality model. According to Simon,
stress can lead to poor judgment in the form of irrational, emotional decisions.
A defining characteristic of Simon's legacy is his ability to integrate theory and practice, and a key element of Simon's impact
on public administration is that he actively sought to address
public administration issues. He laid out his positivist manifesto in “The Proverbs of Public Administration,” which Public
Administration Review (PAR) published in 1946. Simon has famously critiqued the influential scholar Luther Gulick, steering
the field of public administration in a significantly different direction from its earlier course (Georgiou 2013; Hammond 1990).
Later, he addressed bounded rationality and satisficing directly in “Administrative Decision Making,” published by
Public Administration Review (PAR) in 1965. Other seminar
PAR appearances included a review of “The Science of Public
Administration” by Robert Dahl in 1947 (Dahl 1947) and a 1958
reply to a review of his classic book, Administrative Behavior
(Simon 1958). Another notable contribution to public administration appeared in a debate with Dwight Waldo and Peter
Drucker, published by the American Political Science Review in
1952 (Simon, Drucker, and Waldo 1952).
Simon's impact extends beyond public administration to the domain of AI. His work with Allen Newell on the “Logic Theorist”
marked the beginning of AI as a discipline, aiming to model
human cognitive processes using computational tools. In his
1995 article, “Artificial Intelligence: An Empirical Science,”
Simon argued that AI should not replace human judgment but
instead complement it by addressing ill-­structured problems
through heuristic search and satisficing strategies (Simon 1995).

findings of our review, it is essential to summarize the foundational concepts as originally developed by Herbert Simon
and his collaborators, which provide the theoretical underpinnings for our analysis. We begin by tracing the development of
Simon's key concepts, including bounded rationality and satisficing, exploring how these ideas reshaped traditional models
of decision-­making. Subsequently, we connect these theoretical
advancements to more recent developments in AI, highlighting
how Simon's principles have informed contemporary tools and
methods that address complex administrative challenges. By
integrating historical and modern perspectives, this literature
review provides a comprehensive reassessment of rationality assumptions and their implications for decision-­making and governance in the age of AI.

All this, however, only partially reflects Simon's practical importance to AI, both in terms of its foundations and as known
of it today. In recent years, the integration of AI in public administration has further amplified the relevance of bounded
rationality (Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022). Simon's contributions span multiple disciplines, providing a robust framework for understanding decision-­making under constraints. His
emphasis on empirical rigor, interdisciplinarity, and practical
application continues to influence both public administration
and AI, demonstrating the enduring relevance of his work. We
next narrow to this debate.

2.2   |   Focusing AI: Lasting Legacy
and Contemporary Applications of Simon's
Principles in Public Administration
Herbert Simon's work laid the intellectual foundation for AI by
modeling human decision-­making processes. His concept of
bounded rationality has found renewed relevance in the age of
AI, where systems must also operate under constraints of incomplete information, computational limitations, and time pressure.
Much like Simon's “administrative man,” AI systems aim for
satisfactory, rather than optimal, solutions, reflecting the core
principles of bounded rationality. This parallel has profound implications for public administration, where AI tools increasingly
aid decision-­makers in navigating complexity and uncertainty.
The term “artificial intelligence” emerged at the 1956 Dartmouth
workshop, which postulated that intelligence could be attributed to both living beings and machines. Simon, along with
Allen Newell, contributed to this vision by developing the Logic
Theorist, a groundbreaking program that showcased the ability of machines to emulate human cognitive processes (Kumar
et al. 2024; Nilsson 2009; Simon 1995). Their subsequent collaboration with J.C. Shaw led to the creation of the General Problem
Solver in 1959, a system designed to address a wide array of problems by simulating heuristic problem-­solving strategies (Newell,
Shaw, and Simon 2000; Simon 1995). Later, in his 1995 article,
Simon highlighted the central role of heuristics and satisficing
in AI systems, emphasizing that AI should augment human intelligence rather than replace it entirely (Simon 1995). This perspective underscores the enduring alignment between Simon's
theories and contemporary AI applications.
Despite these advancements, AI development has faced significant hurdles. The so-­called “AI winters” arose from overly
optimistic predictions and insufficient technological progress,
resulting in reduced funding and skepticism about the field's potential (Toosi et al. 2021). McCarthy, often referred to as the “father of artificial intelligence,” went on to establish an AI lab at
Stanford University in 1963, further cementing his influence on
the field (Nilsson 2009). However, by 1966, progress had slowed
significantly, as the Automatic Language Processing Advisory
4 of 14

Committee cut funding for machine translation projects in the
U.S., citing limited practical results. This skepticism, mirrored
by the British Science Research Council, led to reduced government support for AI research (Toosi et al. 2021). Setbacks apart,
advancements continued, such as the development of an expert
system in 1969 capable of diagnosing bacterial infections and
recommending antibiotics (Kumar et al. 2024). Simon's emphasis on rigorous, interdisciplinary approaches to decision-­making
provided a resilient framework for AI research during these
periods. For example, the introduction of expert systems in the
1970s and the subsequent development of machine learning
algorithms in the 1980s and 1990s reflected Simon's vision of
AI as a tool for enhancing decision-­making under uncertainty
(Samuel 1959; Simon 1995).
The integration of AI into public administration has further amplified the relevance of Simon's principles. Recent studies have
applied bounded rationality to examine how AI can improve
governance by addressing decision-­making constraints, such
as information overload and cognitive biases. Although Simon's
emphasis on information and decision-­making is evident in
many contemporary studies, these works often fail to address
the structural design of AI and frequently underestimate the
challenges associated with its implementations (Wirtz, Weyerer,
and Sturm 2020). Therefore, challenges remain. Schwarz,
Christensen, and Zhu (2022), in a symposium marking the
75th anniversary of Simon's Administrative Behavior, identified
key questions about the implications of AI for public decision-­
making. The guest editors asked how Simon's structural design theory could enhance advanced information-­processing
methods, how procedural rationality could integrate with other
decision-­
making models, and how to mitigate the potential
“dark sides” of AI in public governance.
The symposium included five articles addressing these different nuances of Simon's work in our current digital societies. Al-­
Hashimi et al. (2022) and Dowding and Taflaga (2022) depart
from the concept of procedural rationality. At the same time, Al-­
Hashimi et al. (2022) highlight the positive association between
procedural rationality and successful strategic decisions in the
public sector in Qatar, Dowding and Taflaga (2022) show that
politically appointed advisors participate in undermining procedural rationality in Australia and the United Kingdom. van der
Voet and Lems (2022), along with Hansen and Nielsen (2022),
use survey experiments to investigate the usage of performance information but in different contexts. van der Voet and
Lems (2022) focus on the decision-­making constructs of “aspiration” and “search,” and, through a survey experiment in Dutch
municipalities, they find that negative performance information
reduces the creativity of policies later implemented. Hansen and
Nielsen (2022) evaluate the behavior of public managers in education departments in Denmark and complemented the work of
Voet and Lems. They find that low-­performance information influences subsequent focus but not managers' intention to engage
in innovation. Lastly, Feduzi, Runde, and Schwarz (2022) build
upon the notion of “black swans” (Taleb 2010)—understood as
consequential shocks that cannot be anticipated based on previous learnings—to distinguish their varieties and later provide
recommendations on how public managers can improve risk
identification mechanisms to reduce exposures and mitigate the
consequences of those events.

He viewed AI as a tool to augment human problem-­solving capabilities, reflecting his broader vision of integrating technological advancements with bounded rationality. This approach
remains deeply relevant in public administration today, where
AI systems are increasingly used to navigate complex decision-­
making landscapes.

We chose bibliometric methods for their ability to quantitatively
and qualitatively assess the impact and reach of Simon's work,
as well as to map relationships between key concepts, publications, and contributors. This approach goes beyond the mere
“availability” of tools by addressing the interdisciplinary and
historically broad nature of Simon's contributions. For instance,
bibliometric analysis enables the identification of trends over
time, thematic clusters, and influential works that may not be
immediately apparent in traditional qualitative reviews (Aria
and Cuccurullo 2017). By integrating these tools, we aimed to
capture the depth and breadth of Simon's legacy in a systematic,
replicable manner, mitigating the risk of subjective biases in article selection or analysis (e.g., Grant and Booth 2009).

Simon's (1995) work on AI, while dating from almost 30 years
before these studies, continues to provide critical insights for
the current debates. He argued that the success of AI systems
depends on their ability to replicate the heuristic strategies used
by humans to manage bounded rationality. Rather than aiming
for perfection, these systems must focus on satisficing outcomes
that align with the complexities of real-­world decision-­making
(Simon 1995). This approach is particularly relevant in public
administration, where decisions often involve competing objectives, limited resources, and high stakes. However, Simon also
cautioned against over-­reliance on AI, emphasizing the need for
human oversight and ethical considerations to mitigate unintended consequences. Addressing these gaps requires bridging
the interdisciplinary insights of Simon's theories with contemporary AI research, such that we do not underestimate AI challenges (Wirtz, Weyerer, and Sturm 2020) and its potential dark
sides (Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022).

Using the WoS database—renowned for its comprehensive and
multidisciplinary coverage—we conducted a targeted search
with the query “Simon, Herbert” in titles, abstracts, and keywords. This choice reflects the need to focus specifically on
works that explicitly cite or engage with Simon's contributions,
ensuring relevance to the review's objectives. Since our earlier
literature review already provides an in-­depth examination of
Simon's own works, this systematic review prioritizes capturing research that constitutes his broader legacy, exploring how
his ideas have been interpreted, applied, and expanded upon
in various fields. The query was restricted to articles written in
English to maintain analytical consistency across the dataset.
Results were exported as BibTeX files to facilitate bibliometric
analysis, enabling insights into publication trends, influential
journals and authors, and recurring concepts in titles, abstracts,
and keywords. These analyses were complemented by a manual
review of abstracts to ensure relevance and accuracy, with text-­
mining techniques applied to manage large datasets.

Ultimately, Simon's ideas continue to shape AI and governance,
providing powerful tools to address bounded rationality in complex administrative environments. Although his work remains
remarkably relevant, it also continues to spark debate. Evidently,
he and his followers still pursue the goal of developing a science
of decision-­making that bridges social psychology, computer science, and public administration. Next, through a systematic review of relevant literature, we unpack how scholars have evolved
and reshaped their understandings and applications of bounded
rationality. We also highlight paths for enhancing the knowledge of academics and practitioners regarding the current and
utmost complex decision-­making processes in the public sector.

3   |   Methods: A Systematic Review and Latent
Dirichlet Analysis
To explore Herbert Simon's contributions to public administration and related fields, we employed a systematic literature
review guided by established frameworks for rigor and transparency in such research (e.g., Grant and Booth 2009). A systematic
approach is particularly well-­suited for synthesizing extensive
and multidisciplinary literature, as it allows for replicability,
minimizes selection bias, and ensures that the review captures
a comprehensive view of Simon's enduring influence. This
approach aligns with our objective of tracing the evolution of
Simon's ideas across public administration and AI while identifying patterns, gaps, and emerging research trajectories in these
fields.

The second stage of the analysis is to conduct a content analysis
of the whole document based on lexical and semantic analyses
(Goddard 2011). This is done by using the Quanteda package
also in RStudio (Benoit et al. 2018). The process involves the
following steps: (1) converting PDF files to TXT documents; (2)
the package is designed to remove stop words and retain only
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. By focusing on these elements,
one can better understand the author's ideas and conclusions
because it allows one to identify the main topics within articles
and the correlation between them (Benoit et al. 2018). We use
the “text mining” and Quanteda packages to conduct LSA and
LDA analyses (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Nowlin 2016). While
the latter helps identify the most recurrent terms in a textual
document, with which one can determine patterns, the former
helps in clustering the words into topics, which, according to
Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003), provides an explicit representation
of a document. The combination of both supports assessing how
Herbert Simon's ideas have been used in public administration
articles.

4   |   Analyses and Findings
In April 2024, we searched using only the Clarivate Web of
Science database. We searched for the keyword “Herbert Simon”
in titles, abstracts, and keywords. It is worth mentioning that
WoS has a distinctive keyword plus, which assembles the most
recurrent words used in the cited reference titles. We focused

These studies collectively not only demonstrate Simon's continued relevance but also highlight areas where his ideas could
evolve to address emerging challenges. As highlighted by the
guest editors (Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022), at least three
questions directly linked to the opportunities and challenges
of AI remain unanswered. First, “How might insights from
Simon's structural design theory contribute to making advanced
information-­processing methods more effective for public decisions?” Second, “How can procedural rationality be combined
with other components of integrative decision-­making models
to best support the implementation of strategic decisions?” And
lastly, “How can the potential dark sides of using artificial intelligence in public decision-­making be mitigated?”

Figure 2 presents the articles' intellectual structure, that is, the
primary cited references for this dataset. The picture is constructed based on the network parameters betweenness, closeness, and PageRank. In general terms, they assess how many
citations the references received from the articles, which indicates their importance for the field. Eyeballing the figure, we
see three clusters: blue, red, and green. The article with the highest power of attraction in the blue network is the classical “A
Behavioral Model of Rational Choice” (Simon 1955). The second
most relevant is “Rational choice and the structure of the environment” (Simon 1956). The third is “Human Problem-­Solving”
(Newell and Simon 1972). These articles suggest the blue network as a congregation of documents related to rational choice.

The articles are published in 186 journals. Table 1 demonstrates
the most relevant journals, representing about 17% of the total.
For this sample, there is an indication that the production derives mainly from Economics, Management, and Computer
Science. However, we will deal with the theoretical orientation
later when analyzing the content of the articles.

4.1   |   Full Document Analysis

In Table 2, there is an analysis of two types of keywords: author keywords and keyword plus. The author's keywords focus
on terms related to decision-­making, such as bounded rationality, rationality, and satisficing. This suggests that Simon's ideas
on AI are being used. The keyword plus analysis reveals that
the most commonly used terms in the cited reference titles are
related to decision-­making factors such as choice, psychology,
information, and rationality. These terms are important in shaping the arguments and assumptions of the articles.

As mentioned, the content analysis is done by transforming PDF
files into textual files and removing the numbers, symbols, and
stop words. The idea is to have only nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
After analyzing the abstracts, we removed 74 documents, leaving us with 193 for the final sample. Figure 3 illustrates the most
recurrent terms in the analysis, with the darker types representing the most common terms across the 194 documents.

only on English-­w ritten articles. The query process resulted
in 267 articles. The bibliometric analysis presented in this first
moment includes the whole set of documents. The dataset comprises articles published since 1975, with an annual percentage
growth rate of 4.05. As Figure 1 demonstrates, there has been an
increase in publications in the last 20 years, with a remarkable
number in 2017.

One form of lexical analysis involves determining documents'
most commonly used terms. The term “rationality” is the most
frequently used, suggesting that articles inspired by Herbert
Simon's ideas are centered around the concept of rationality.

The second-­most commonly used term is “decision.” After this,
we encounter information that forms the basis of the decision-­
making process. Subsequently, human, economics, behavior,
problem, economic, work, and process are the 10 most frequently occurring terms.
After looking at single words, the Quanteda package offers an
algorithm to assess when and where some words appear together—that is, a collocation analysis. Table 3 presents the
results for the 10 most recurrent pairs of words. It is worth mentioning the importance of the z score, which indicates the probability of these two words appearing together in the documents.
Z's interpretation is the higher the score, the higher the probability (Benoit et al. 2018). Rationality and decision-­making are
the two most repeated terms. After them, we see rational choice,
problem-­solving, AI, and creative commons.

After assessing each term's importance, we conducted a cluster
analysis to group words into topics. Figure 4 illustrates this analysis, where the length of the term is defined. In topic one, we
can see that rationality is related to humans, problems, behavior,

Rationality is the word with the highest number of citations.
After that, decision, science, problem, bounded, information.
The removal was due to the impossibility of accessing their PDF
files and needing more citations for specific articles. We carried
out lexical and semantic analyses on the documents using the
LDA for the cluster analysis (Nowlin 2016). To help identify the
clusters, LDA calculates beta and gamma coefficients. Beta measures the probability of a term being associated with a particular
topic, and gamma is the probability of a term being associated
with a document.

Observing the terms in topic 1 more carefully, the ones with the
higher probability of belonging to it are rationality, human, problem, cognition, bounded, economics, and behavior. Therefore,
there is a high probability that this topic refers to behavioral
studies around cognitive and psychological studies trying to
figure out the best possible rationality to face problems. The
second topic has the terms decision, choice, and making, associated with process, performance, and satisficing. This suggests
these are the cases of studies concerned with proposing processes, systems, and information to improve decision-­making.
In the third topic, the terms work, organization, administration,
and business induce us to think that this is the case of organizational structure, processes, and practices to make decisions
more effective.
These are, however, preliminary insights. By examining the
documents more closely, we delve deeper into these topics with
additional insights from the LDA. LDA allows for assessing the

relationship between topics and documents, as demonstrated
in Table 4, where we present the 10 highest gammas for each
topic. Here, we focus on coefficients higher than 0.9. Articles
“Intuition, Computation, and Information” (Herold 2014),
“Statistical Models of Text in Continuous Speech Recognition”,
(Chen 1991), and “Bounded rationality in the economics of organization: ‘Much cited and little used’” (Foss 2003) have the highest gammas in topic 1. We refer to this topic as the one centered
on “Rationality and Decision-­Making.”
Articles “Human Problem-­Solving: Standing on the Shoulders
of the Giants” (Navaneethakrishnan 2021), “From Selz to
Gigerenzer: A thought-­
psychological research history, which
needs a Popperian, fallibilist theory of rationality to effectively
develop” (Wettersten 2017), and “Information and the Internet:
An Analysis from the Perspective of the Science of the Artificial”
(Arrojo 2017) are the highest in topic 2 (referred to as “Human
Choice and Performance”).
Finally, the articles “Applying bounded rationality to information disposition: development of a risk/reward heuristic” (Barragan 2022), “A Version of Herbert A. Simon's Model
with Slowly Fading Memory and Its Connections to Branching
Processes” (Bertoin 2019), and “Entrepreneurship as a Science of
the Artificial” (Sarasvathy 2003) are the highest in topic 3 (referred to as “Work, Organizations, and Knowledge”). Below, we
discuss the three most representative articles to illustrate their
coherence with the topic.

4.2.1   |   Topic 1: Rationality and Decision-­Making
The highest-­
gamma article for this topic, “Intuition,
Computation, and Information” (Herold 2014) explores the philosophy of information, including the relationship between data
structures and information objects, and discusses perception,
intuition, computation, and information in acquiring knowledge. It draws on the work of philosophers and theorists like
Luciano Floridi and Alan Turing, proposing a model that connects these concepts through cognitive continuity, temporality,
and constitution. It aims to understand how we experience and
process information at different levels, suggesting that these interconnected experiences shape our world knowledge.
Second, the article “Statistical Models of Text in Continuous
Speech Recognition,” by Chen (1991), recommends the importance of statistical models of text in continuous speech

cognition, etc. In the second topic, we find decisions related to
choice, systems, processes, and satisficing. These terms are
likely to indicate efforts to depict structures supporting decision-­
making. Finally, in topic three, work is related to administration,
business, organizations, decisions, processes, social, decision,
economics, design, and so on. The combination of these words is
likely to indicate that the authors have concentrated on theories
and processes to support economic and social decisions.

recognition and the importance of using statistical models to
understand and generate text in the context of AI. The article
highlights the significance of Zipf's law and the development
of various statistical models, such as the multinomial urn,
Markov chain, Mandelbrot–Zipf, and Simon–Yule models in text
generation. Overall, the article underscores the importance of
statistical models in advancing research in continuous speech
recognition and text generation.
Third, in the article titled “Bounded rationality in the economics of organization: ‘Much cited and little used’,” the author
Foss (2003) discusses the concept of Bounded Rationality, developed by Simon and often used in the context of firm theory.
Despite Simon's efforts, bounded rationality has only been partially absorbed into the economics of organization and is used
more for rhetorical purposes than substantive ones. The article compares different approaches to integrating bounded rationality with economic organization theory. It concludes that
bounded rationality is often treated superficially and is not essential to producing the central insights of these theories. The
article suggests that the lack of a specific program to incorporate bounded rationality into the economics of an organization,
which would be acceptable to most economists, is one of the reasons for its incomplete absorption.
Interestingly, the only article within this first topic's top-­
10
gamma published on a public administration outlet is “Compared
to what? How social and historical reference points affect citizens'
performance evaluations” (Olsen 2017). In this piece, Olsen discusses how citizens evaluate public services, taking reference
points into account. This is based on Simon's seminal work on
social and historical reference points (Simon 1937, 1939). Olsen
finds that, although citizens' evaluation of an organization is affected by absolute performance and the performance relative to
an available reference point, not all reference points are of equal
importance. His findings indicate that social reference points

impact citizens' evaluations more significantly than historical
ones. These discussions are closely related to those in other articles on the same topic, exploring the information philosophy.
They examine the relationship between data structures and
information objects and delve into aspects such as perception,
intuition, computation, and the role of information in acquiring
knowledge.
Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that more recent work
on public administration draws from Simon's concepts and new
developments in behavioral economics; such studies are often
associated with the subfield of behavioral public administration
(James, Jilke, and Van Ryzin 2017). For instance, Belardinelli,
Bellé, and Cantarelli (2021) build upon the bounded subadditivity principle (Tversky and Fox 1995) and investigate whether
and why public and private sector workers prefer projects where
their involvement would ensure success over those where their
participation would significantly increase, but not guarantee,
the likelihood of success.
4.2.2   |   Topic 2: Human Choice and Performance
The article “Human Problem-­
Solving: Standing on the
Shoulders of the Giants” by Dharmaraj Navaneethakrishnan
(Navaneethakrishnan 2021), published in Computational
Economics, explores the historical and theoretical foundations
of human problem-­solving, tracing its development from cognitive psychology, philosophy, economics, and computer science.
It reviews key contributions from pioneers like Herbert Simon,
Allen Newell, and Cliff Shaw and philosophical and psychological influences from figures such as Socrates, Plato, Wundt,
and Brentano. The evolution from association theory to Gestalt
psychology is detailed, highlighting contributions from the
Würzburg School and Gestalt psychologists. The article emphasizes the integration of these diverse influences into a cohesive

Second, the article “From Selz to Gigerenzer: A thought-­
psychological research history, which needs a Popperian, fallibilist theory of rationality to effectively develop” by John
Wettersten (Wettersten 2017) discusses two distinct traditions
in the philosophy of science and thought psychology that originated from Otto Selz's work. One tradition, influenced by Karl
Popper, lacks integration with empirical studies of thought processes, while the other, associated with Herbert Simon and Gerd
Gigerenzer, is based on inductivist philosophy. The author argues for a synthesis of these traditions, suggesting that Popper's
fallibilist framework should be combined with empirical studies
to advance both fields. This integration would address the shortcomings of both traditions and foster significant progress in understanding human rationality and thought processes.
Third, the article “Information and the Internet: An Analysis
from the Perspective of the Science of the Artificial” by Maria
Jose Arrojo (Arrojo 2017) delves into the role of information on
the Internet, investigating the development of AI as a tool for
communication processes. The author challenges Simon's view
by arguing that he focuses on structural complexity while communicative designs of the Internet phenomena would require
lenses based on dynamic complexity. In sum, she argues that his
concept of the artificial focuses on structure and evolution but
lacks the historical context vital for communication sciences,
particularly in the dynamic context of the Internet. To grasp
Internet information, communication sciences must be viewed
as applied design sciences, addressing the new transversal and
longitudinal communication forms of the Internet and understanding the objectives, processes, and outcomes at various
communicative levels.
This topic also includes the work of Bryan D. Jones titled
“Bounded Rationality and Public Policy: Herbert A. Simon and
the decisional foundation of collective choice” (Jones 2002). Bryan
published that piece in the journal Policy Sciences in 2002, and,
drawing heavily from that work, he published the following
year in the Journal of Administration Research and Theory another titled “Bounded Rationality and Political Science: Lessons
from Public Administration and Public Policy” (Jones 2003).
In these two pieces, the author advocates for a behavioral approach to public policy and public administration that prioritizes information processing and problem-­solving rather than
control mechanisms. Additionally, he critiques the limitations
of principal-­agent models and calls for a more profound understanding of how organizations process information and make
decisions in the face of uncertainty. Both these pieces, in turn,
develop ideas from his seminal works theorizing on choice and
decision-­making within the public sector (Jones 1994a, 1994b)—
of course, all building upon several of Simon's concepts.
Along these lines, studies have been featured in the Public
Administration throughout the years. Part of the reason behind
Jones's critiques targeting studies overfocusing control mechanisms, Egeberg (1999), for instance, delves into the consequences
of bureaucracy on policymaking. There are other examples of
conceptual and empirical articles drawing from Simon's ideas
while focusing on the performance of public organizations. For
10 of 14

example, Kenis and Provan (2009) theorize about the performance of public networks, while Rutherford and Meier (2015)
empirically investigate how public managers prioritize competing performance goals using data from a survey of university
presidents.
Moreover, it is important to highlight that other studies published in outlets that are considered to be from other fields
also discuss topics that are closely related to concerns of public administration, such as Hanoch and Rice (2006) and Van
Regenmortel (2018), discussing, respectively, the choices of the
elderly in terms of health insurance and the design of vaccine
programs.
4.2.3   |   Topic 3: Work, Organization, and Knowledge
The article titled “Applying bounded rationality to information disposition: development of a risk/reward heuristic,” by
Barragan (2022) explores the application of Herbert Simon's
concept of bounded rationality to records and information management (RIM), particularly in the context of information disposition. It argues that bounded rationality, which acknowledges
human cognitive limitations and uses heuristics for decision-­
making, can provide insights into why organizations often fail
to dispose of information as per their retention schedules. The
risk/reward heuristic, which involves weighing the risks of losing potentially valuable information against the rewards of minimizing data retention, is identified as a key factor influencing
this behavior. The author suggests that this heuristic leads to the
prevalent keep-­everything approach due to the fear of needing
the information later. By incorporating bounded rationality into
RIM practices, the paper posits that new decision-­making processes can be developed, potentially enhancing the effectiveness
of information lifecycle policies and reducing unnecessary data
retention.
Second, the piece titled “A Version of Herbert A. Simon's Model
with Slowly Fading Memory and Its Connections to Branching
Processes,” was written by Bertoin (2019). It explores a variation of Simon's (1955) model to account for memory that decays
slowly over time. The model generates a sequence of words.
Each new word has a fixed probability of being a new word and
a complementary probability of repeating a previous word, with
a preference that depends on its position in the sequence. The
study demonstrates that the proportion of distinct words occurring a fixed number of times converges to a probability mass
function, with the tail behavior dependent on the innovation
parameter. The research also links this model to branching processes, providing a detailed analysis of its statistical properties.
Despite losing the Markov property, the model's behavior can be
closely related to certain branching processes.
Third, the article titled “Entrepreneurship as a Science of the
Artificial” by Sarasvathy (Sarasvathy 2003) integrates Herbert
Simon's key ideas from “Sciences of the Artificial” into entrepreneurial research. It discusses four main concepts: natural
laws' constraints on design, the avoidance of prediction in design, the significance of locality and contingency, and near-­
decomposability in enduring designs. Through empirical studies
and extensive conversations with Simon, the author develops the

understanding of problem-­solving and discusses future research
directions in the field.

Interestingly, within this topic, none of the top 10 papers have
been published in public administration journals, even though
we see, for instance, publications in varied areas such as physics
(Bertoin 2019), economic theory (Tyson 2008), economic psychology (Minkes and Foxall 2003; Sarasvathy 2003), and history
of science (Kline 2020). As we discuss next, although we see that
Simon's ideas and concepts have diffused across scientific areas,
their dissemination within the public administration literature is
not yet as consolidated in terms of the understanding of systems
for recording and managing information. Even though we are
moving to the “information era,” concerns raised by Jones more
than two decades ago (Jones 2002, 2003) related to the overfocus
of public administration on control mechanisms instead of information processing and problem-­solving are persistent.

5   |   Venues for Further Investigations
This systematic review reaffirms Herbert Simon's profound influence on public administration and AI, emphasizing his enduring relevance to decision-­making in complex organizational
contexts. The review highlights foundational contributions
while identifying several areas where Simon's ideas could be
extended or revisited to address emerging challenges in AI and
public governance.
First, advancing decision-­
making frameworks with AI into
public administration provides a unique opportunity to operationalize Simon's bounded rationality framework in novel ways.
Current studies demonstrate AI's potential to address cognitive
constraints and manage complexity (Schwarz, Christensen, and
Zhu 2022). However, empirical research is needed to evaluate
its effectiveness in diverse public sector contexts. Future investigations should assess how AI-­driven tools enhance decision-­
making under uncertainty, emphasizing their ability to balance
satisficing with ethical considerations (Kumar et al. 2024;
Wirtz, Weyerer, and Sturm 2020). For example, the application
of bounded rationality in machine learning algorithms remains
underexplored and could yield insights into improving decision outcomes while reducing algorithmic biases (Bostrom and
Yudkowsky 2018). These tools could also support public administrators in managing information overload, addressing challenges identified by Simon's original work on decision-­making
under constraints (Simon 1947), and using historical reference
points (Olsen 2017; Simon 1937, 1939). In summary, a key
question remains: How can bounded rationality be operationalized within machine learning algorithms to improve decision-­
making outcomes while addressing ethical considerations and
algorithmic biases in diverse public sector contexts?
Second, Simon's interdisciplinary approach—spanning cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and administrative
sciences—remains underutilized in public administration
literature. Scholars should prioritize bridging these silos to
integrate cognitive insights and behavioral approaches into

administrative frameworks. Linking insights from cognitive
psychology and behavioral economics with administrative science could refine frameworks for managing complexity and
uncertainty (Dowding and Taflaga 2022; Schwoerer et al. 2022).
For instance, heuristic processes shaping policy design and organizational learning, particularly in environments of high uncertainty, merit further exploration (Jones 2002; Kahneman 2003;
Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022). Expanding this cross-­
disciplinary dialogue aligns with Simon's call for integrative
scholarship (Simon 1995) and offers opportunities to refine
decision-­
making frameworks that address both administrative and cognitive challenges (e.g., Hansen and Nielsen 2022).
To conclude, we pose the question: What are the mechanisms
through which cognitive psychology and behavioral economics
can be integrated with administrative science to create more effective frameworks for managing complexity and uncertainty in
public administration?
Third, AI not only offers transformative potential but also
presents significant risks, such as ethical dilemmas, workforce
displacement, and erosion of public trust (Moon 2023; Wirtz,
Weyerer, and Sturm 2020). Simon's cautionary stance on the
over-­reliance on technology (Simon 1995) provides a foundation
for addressing these challenges. Future research should explore
governance models that balance AI's benefits with its risks, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. AI technologies designed to mimic human cognitive processes often
utilize algorithms approximating satisficing behavior, reflecting
Simon's bounded rationality model (Simon 1995). However, the
ethical and social implications of AI remain a critical area for
future research. For example, governance frameworks could
focus on fostering public trust in AI systems while mitigating discriminatory practices in algorithmic decision-­
making
(Schwartz 2002; Schwarz, Christensen, and Zhu 2022). Inclusive
and transparent AI systems, grounded in the principles of
bounded rationality, can help mitigate risks and maximize benefits for public governance (Moon 2023; Wirtz, Weyerer, and
Sturm 2020). Addressing these challenges is essential for ensuring that AI-­driven decision-­making aligns with democratic
values and societal needs. Therefore, the main question here is:
What governance models can effectively balance the benefits
and risks of AI in public administration, ensuring transparency,
accountability, and inclusivity while fostering public trust in AI
systems?
Fourth, procedural rationality, a cornerstone of Simon's theoretical contributions, has significant implications for designing
AI systems that support strategic decision-­making (Schwarz,
Christensen, and Zhu 2022; Simon 1947). This review identifies gaps in its application to AI, creating an opportunity that
warrants further investigation. Researchers should explore how
procedural rationality can inform the development of adaptive
AI tools, particularly those designed for resilience and context-­
sensitive governance. Understanding how procedural rationality
interacts with other decision-­making models could enhance its
utility in addressing the unique challenges of public administration (Dowding and Taflaga 2022; van der Voet and Lems 2022).
Thus, we call for further research to address the question: How
can procedural rationality inform the development of adaptive
AI systems designed to enhance resilience and context-­sensitive
governance in addressing public administration challenges?

effectuation theory, which highlights how expert entrepreneurs
use inverse causation to create markets and firms, differing from
traditional predictive approaches. The paper emphasizes how
effectuation and Simon's principles together explain the creation
and growth of high-­performing entrepreneurial ventures.

Ultimately, Herbert Simon's ideas continue to provide an invaluable lens for navigating the complexities of decision-­making in
the digital age. By building on his interdisciplinary insights,
revisiting procedural rationality, and addressing the ethical
challenges of AI, future research can extend Simon's legacy, ensuring its relevance in a rapidly evolving societal and technological landscape.

6   |   Concluding Remarks
This paper has critically examined Herbert Simon's enduring
legacy in public administration, particularly through the lens of
bounded rationality and its profound influence on AI. By synthesizing decades of research, we highlight the enduring relevance of Simon's concepts for understanding decision-­making in
complex organizational and technological contexts.
Central to Simon's contributions is the emphasis on satisficing
and heuristic processes as practical alternatives to unattainable
optimization. As Simon (1995) argued, these approaches provide a robust framework for tackling the “ill-­structured” problems inherent in public administration, offering critical lessons
for integrating AI into decision-­making. The threefold goals of
AI outlined by Simon—modeling intelligence, understanding
human cognitive processes, and augmenting decision-­making
with expert systems—remain highly pertinent. His assertion
that AI should supplement rather than replace human judgment
underscores the necessity of ethical oversight and the alignment
of AI systems with human-­centric values.
Our findings emphasize that Simon's critique of the fragmentation of AI research, which he viewed as undermining the interdisciplinary dialogue necessary for solving complex problems,
is particularly relevant in the digital age. Bridging cognitive science, behavioral economics, and public administration, as Simon
advocated, is vital for developing decision-­making systems that
are not only efficient but also equitable and accountable. This
integration can address critical issues such as transparency, inclusivity, and the unintended consequences of AI deployment.
Despite its contributions, this study acknowledges several limitations. The focus on English-­language sources and the use of
12 of 14

specific bibliometric tools, while methodologically sound, may
not capture the full breadth of Simon's influence across diverse
scholarly traditions. Furthermore, while our content analysis sheds light on thematic trends, it cannot fully address the
contextual nuances of Simon's interdisciplinary legacy. Future
research should adopt broader methodological approaches
and engage in empirical studies that assess the real-­
world
implications of AI-­
driven decision-­
making tools in public
administration.
In the spirit of Simon's call for an empirical science of AI
(Simon 1995), future work must explore how public administration can harness AI's potential while mitigating its risks.
Empirical research evaluating AI applications in areas such
as resource allocation, crisis management, and citizen engagement is imperative to validate and extend Simon's insights.
Such studies will ensure that Simon's vision of informed, responsible, and adaptive decision-­making continues to guide the
evolution of governance in the age of AI. Simon's legacy serves
as a beacon for navigating the complexities of modern governance. By drawing on his foundational principles and applying them to contemporary challenges, public administration
can develop integrative frameworks that enhance decision-­
making, advance ethical AI integration, and foster trust in public institutions.

Fifth, Simon's fundamental concepts provide a robust framework for addressing contemporary challenges in public administration, including resilience-­building, managing black swan
events, and fostering participatory governance (Feduzi, Runde,
and Schwarz 2022; Taleb 2010). The intersection of Simon's design science principles with modern AI applications offers an
avenue for innovative decision-­making tools that enhance both
efficiency and equity (Sarasvathy 2003; Schwarz, Christensen,
and Zhu 2022). Additionally, future research should investigate
the cultural and institutional contexts that shape the application
of Simon's theories, particularly in addressing complex governance issues in the digital age (Jones 1994a, 1994b; Olsen 2017).
To conclude, our final proposed question is: How can Simon's
design science principles be applied to develop AI-­driven tools
that address black swan events and promote participatory governance while accounting for cultural and institutional contexts
in public administration?
