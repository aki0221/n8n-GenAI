Abstract
In all phases of life, people face decisions with important consequences. Weighing options involves using cognitive resources
to assess valence, delay, and risk to achieve a desired outcome. Value-based decision-making changes over the lifespan, but
studies disagree on the extent, domains, and mechanisms of this change. We assessed delay discounting, risk aversion for
probabilistic gains, risk seeking for probabilistic losses, loss aversion as well as cognitive abilities, and processing noise in
86 young (25–38 years) and 93 older (63–76 years) adults. We tested whether decision-making differed between age groups
and whether differences were mediated by cognitive abilities or processing noise as measured by reaction time variability and
decision inconsistency. Older adults showed steeper delay discounting (p = .003) and trended towards more risk aversion for
gains (p = .071). Age groups did not differ in risk seeking for losses or loss aversion. Lower decision consistency and better
spatial working memory mediated older adults’ steeper delay discounting. The relationship between delay discounting and
age persisted when controlling for both mediators, suggesting robust age differences in delay discounting. This persistent
age difference implies mechanisms beyond noise or cognitive parameters, such as changing life circumstances or limited
future perspective.

and risk to achieve the desired outcome depending on the
subjective evaluation of the probability or uncertainty of an
outcome.
Delay discounting—i.e., the tendency of individuals to
devalue or discount future rewards and to prefer smaller
immediate over larger delayed rewards (Green et al.,
1999)—has frequently been studied. Individual studies on
the association of aging with delay discounting revealed
mixed results, with some showing no difference between
young and older adults (Mata, et al., 2011; Samanez-Larkin
et al., 2011; Whelan & McHugh, 2009) and others finding
a stronger preference for delayed over immediate rewards
in older adults (Bixter & Rogers, 2019; Eppinger et al.,
2012; Green et al., 1994, 1999; Löckenhoff et al., 2011) or,
conversely, in young adults (Read & Read, 2004). A recent
meta-analysis of 50 publications totaling 115,496 participants (125 effect sizes extracted) has revealed a significant,
but very small, negative correlation (r = − 0.04) between age
and delay discounting (Bagaïni et al., 2023). The authors
conclude that the estimated effect size is so low that it is
trivially small.

Regarding risk-taking tasks, research indicates greater
risk aversion towards probabilistic gains among older adults
(Mather et al., 2012; Rutledge et al., 2016; Tymula et al.,
2013). Yet, conflicting results arise when tasks require
choosing between two risky options (Mather et al., 2012;
Pachur et al., 2017). The first meta-analysis (Best & Charness, 2015) reported a weak (g = − 0.25) but significant
association of age and risk taking in the gain domain, and is
in line with the recent meta-analysis (Bagaïni et al., 2023)
that also reported a slight but significant decline in risk seeking for gains with age (r = − 0.05). While young and older
adults show comparable choice behavior in decision-making
tasks that fully disclose the information about outcome probabilities, age differences might be more apparent in tasks
requiring the outcome probabilities to be learned (Mata
et al., 2011), highlighting potential effects of task design.
Some studies investigating discounting of probabilistic
losses suggest that older adults take more risks to avoid
losses (Best & Freund, 2018; Fernandes et al., 2018; Mather
et al., 2012), yet the (online) study with the largest sample
size (> 25,000 participants) found no respective age-related
differences (Rutledge et al., 2016). In line with the latter,
both meta-analyses cited above (Bagaïni et al., 2023; Best
& Charness, 2015) did not find significant associations
between age and risk taking in the loss domain (r = 0.02
and g = − 0.02, respectively).
Regarding tasks with mixed probabilistic outcomes, the
large (online) study identified a small (r = 0.02), non-monotonic, but significant increase in risk taking across the adult
lifespan when looking at decision-making behavior in tasks
involving both potential gains and losses (Rutledge et al.,
2016). The literature is unclear about how decision-making in these mixed tasks may change with increasing adult
age, with studies reporting a reduced willingness to gamble
(Arora & Kumari, 2015; O’Brien & Hess, 2020), referred
to as loss aversion. However, again, other studies found no
differences in loss aversion (Li et al., 2013; Seaman et al.,
2018). The aforementioned meta-analysis by Bagaïni and
colleagues (2023) found also no significant effect of age on
the mixed domain (r = 0.012).
Discrepancies in findings regarding delay discounting
could partly be related to high inter-individual differences
(Kanai & Rees, 2011) or variations in the duration of delays
(Leverett et al., 2022). Factors contributing to inconsistencies in the literature on risk attitudes might be due to different task characteristics regarding probability discounting
(Mata et al., 2011) and loss aversion (Rutledge et al., 2016;
Seaman et al., 2018). A nonlinear relationship between age
and decision parameters (Guttman et al., 2021), demographic
factors such as income status (Green et al., 1996), or the cultural context in which the studies were conducted (Rieger &
Mata, 2015) may also explain some variance in the observed
decision behaviors. Also whether studies are performed in

the laboratory or online, possibly due to variations in sample
characteristics, seem to moderate associations that seem to
be of small effect size (Bagaïni et al., 2023).
Several theories elucidate potential age-related disparities in decision-making between young and older adults.
These theories on aging-related changes in decision-making
behavior can be categorized into biological or neurodegeneration-related mechanisms versus social psychological
phenomena. A prominent hypothesis and representative of
biological theories is the frontal aging hypothesis, which
postulates that the frontal lobes are especially vulnerable
to aging-related deteriorations with potentially adverse
effects on higher cognitive functions like problem-solving,
memory retention, and attention control (West, 1996). Neuromodulation theories further relate aging-related changes
in neurotransmitter systems such as the dopamine system
to age differences in decision-making, including changes in
reward evaluation and risk tolerance (e.g., Eppinger et al.,
2011). In addition, aging-related changes in relevant brain
structures or in the efficiency of communication within the
neural networks involved in decision-making processes are
also assumed to impact reward processing (Best & Charness, 2015; Raz et al., 1998) as well as decision speed and
accuracy (Bennett & Madden, 2014). These changes may be
associated with increased cognitive noise (Li & Sikström,
2002; Li et al., 2001a, 2001b; MacDonald et al., 2009;
Pachur et al., 2017), which in turn could affect decisionmaking processes in older age. Previous work (MacDonald
et al., 2009, 2012; Papenberg et al., 2013) suggests that intraindividual response variability, i.e., trial-by-trial fluctuations
in response behavior such as response time, can serve as
behavioral indicators of neuronal noise. The aging-related
increase in intra-individual response variability (hereafter referred to as processing noise) is often associated
with reduced cognitive performance or a bias towards less
demanding cognitive strategies in older age (Glöckner et al.,
2021; cf. MacDonald et al., 2009 for review). In the context
of decision-making, for example, individuals with higher
levels of processing noise seem to prefer certain or immediate outcomes over delayed ones (Burks et al., 2009; Mather
et al., 2012). Moreover, increasing the salience of information during value-based decision-making can improve choice
behavior in older adults, presumably by increasing the distinctiveness of value representations (i.e., reducing noise in
representations) and thereby reducing the cognitive demands
during value computation (Chen et al., 2021). Regarding
social psychological theories, the socioemotional selectivity
theory (Carstensen, 2006) is of specific relevance and postulates that individuals prioritize emotional fulfillment as they
age, recognizing the finite nature of their lifetime, which
might impact the way older adults evaluate rewards and risk.
In summary, the literature reviewed above highlights the
complexity of decision-making processes across the adult

lifespan. While various studies have contributed valuable
insights, a considerable uncertainty remains in understanding how these processes evolve with age. This study, which
was conducted between June 2017 and October 2020, investigated whether older adults (63–76 years) and young adults
(25–38 years) differ in four dimensions of value-based decision-making: delay discounting, risk attitudes towards probabilistic gains and probabilistic losses, and loss aversion. In
addition, we investigated differences in cognitive abilities
and processing noise between young and older adults and
explored potential mediating effects of these variables on
choice behavior. Our study used four computerized tasks
providing full information on delays or odds and visual representations of probabilities to minimize cognitive load. We
examined whether measures of crystallized abilities (verbal
knowledge) and fluid abilities (specifically working memory
and speed of processing), or processing noise (i.e., reaction
time variability and decision consistency) might mediate or
mask potential decision-making differences related to age.
We hypothesized that reduced working memory capacity and
increased processing noise in older adults might be associated with a preference for safer or earlier options. Thus, we
expected older adults to demonstrate steeper temporal discounting, higher probability discounting for gains (indicating higher risk aversion), lower probability discounting for
losses (indicating less risk seeking), and higher loss aversion
compared to young adults. If age-related differences were
observed, we anticipated that basic cognitive abilities such
as working memory and speed of processing or processing noise parameters might mediate the observed age group
differences.

Materials and Methods
This study is part of the “Aging and dopamine modulation
of complementary control processes” project within the
Collaborative Research Center 940 “Volition and Cognitive
Control” (www.​sfb940.​de).

Participants
We recruited young (25–38 years) and older adults
(63–76 years) by sending 5927 study information letters
to addresses provided by the resident registration office of
Dresden, Germany. We screened 672 interested adults via
telephone interview and excluded 485. Exclusion criteria
were severely impaired vision or hearing without correction,
a lifetime history of major neurological or mental disorders,
intake of drugs with potential impact on the dopaminergic
system, and contraindications to L-DOPA or magnetic resonance imaging. We excluded all participants who tested
positive for commonly used drugs (i.e., methamphetamine,

amphetamine, morphine, benzodiazepines, and cocaine;
urine test; SureStep, Innovacon, San Diego, CA, USA) or
alcohol (breath alcohol analysis; Alcotest 6581 med, Dräger,
Lübeck, Germany). Older adults completed the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for global dementia screening and were excluded if they scored fewer than 19 points
to ensure a minimal level of cognitive function, while still
including a range of cognitive abilities typical of older
adults. This cutoff was selected based on research suggesting that lower MoCA scores can be indicative of significant
cognitive impairment (Nasreddine et al., 2005), yet using a
cutoff of 18 allows for the inclusion of individuals with mild
cognitive deficits who can still meaningfully participate in
decision-making tasks. In this study, 4 older participants
were in the < 23 range, indicating mild cognitive impairment
(Carson et al., 2018). The final sample included 86 young
adults (M = 31.08, SD = 2.98 years of age; 35 women) and 93
older adults (M = 69.06, SD = 3.14 years of age; 37 women).
Participants received €34 for compensation and an additional
performance-based payment (M = €17.86). During data collection (2017–2020), the Euro to US Dollar exchange rate
fluctuated between approximately 1.12 and 1.22.

Value‑Based Decision‑Making Battery
We used a value-based decision-making battery consisting
of four tasks (Pooseh et al., 2018) to measure delay discounting and risk taking. An example depiction of the four tasks
as they were presented to the participants on the computer
screen is provided in Fig. 1. In the delay discounting task,
participants decided between an immediate smaller and a
larger reward (€3–50) available at varying delays (3, 7, 14,
31, 61, 180, 365 days).
In the probability discounting for gains and losses tasks,
participants chose between an uncertain higher and a certain smaller reward or loss ranging from €3 to 50. To limit
demands for abstraction and numeracy skills, the different
probabilities (2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5) were visually represented by ratios of blanks and wins or losses in two jars
(Fernandes et al., 2018).
In the mixed gambles task, participants accepted or
rejected a gamble with a 50% chance of winning (€1–40)
and losing (€5–20) after receiving a one-time deposit of
€10 to encourage gambling (Ert & Erev, 1930). Each task
consisted of 50 trials with two offers presented simultaneously. The responses, which were limited to five seconds,
were registered on standard keyboards, and the selected
option was highlighted with a green frame. Participants
saw the outcome of each decision in risk taking tasks.
They were informed at the beginning that for each of
the four tasks one of their decisions would be randomly
selected and monetary compensation for study participation would be increased by the corresponding bonus

Fig. 1  Illustration of Exemplary Tasks from the Value-Based Decision-Making Battery. Throughout the battery, the amounts, probabilities, and delays were systematically varied. In delay discounting
tasks, participants were presented with a choice between receiving an
immediate payout or opting for a larger amount to be paid out after a
delay, for example, in two weeks. During the probability discounting

for gains task, participants had the option to select between a guaranteed gain and a larger, but uncertain gain. In the probability discounting for losses task, individuals were faced with the decision between
a certain, smaller loss and a larger, uncertain loss. In the mixed gambles task, participants could choose either not to play, or to engage
with a 50% chance of either incurring a loss or achieving a win

amount (minimum bonus = 0). Participants were instructed
that the bonus payout could be delayed depending on the
decisions they made in the delay discounting task, but
basic monetary compensation was ultimately done without
delay for administrative reasons. The average time taken
to complete the entire test battery was 21.6 min (SD = 3.4;
range = 15.1–34.4).
The battery employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm
based on trial-by-trial observations that updates offers following a hyperbolic function according to the individual
indifference point (no preference for either offer). The
likelihood of choosing between offers is described by a
softmax probability function. Further information regarding the mathematical framework of the battery is provided
by Pooseh et al. (2018).
Individuals exhibit higher delay discounting when they
prefer smaller immediate gains (high k) and lower delay
discounting when they choose larger delayed options (low
k). Risk seeking individuals are more likely to accept the
possibility of winning nothing to maximize outcomes (low
k), whereas risk averse individuals favor smaller certain
gains (high k). In the probability discounting for losses
task, risk seeking individuals take the chance of losing a
higher amount to avoid any loss (high k), and risk averse
adults tend to choose a certain loss to prevent higher losses
(low k). Loss-averse individuals (high λ) prefer maintaining the amount of money they possess at the start over taking the risk of losing or winning money (Tom et al., 2007).
We applied a natural logarithmic transformation of k and
λ values to approximate the data to a normal distribution.
Five participants had missing data for at least one task.

Cognitive Covariates
To account for fluid cognitive abilities, we evaluated working memory for spatial locations and serial order, and perceptual processing speed (Identical Pictures Task). A verbal
comprehension task (Spot-a-Word test) was implemented
as a correlate of crystallized cognitive abilities (specifically
verbal knowledge). All tests relating to the cognitive variables took 30 min, including a 5-min briefing. The cognitive
tasks and covariate measures are described in greater detail
below.
Verbal Knowledge
In a modified version of the Spot-a-Word test (Lindenberger
et al., 1993), participants were asked to identify the one true
word among five words, of which four were pronounceable
non-words, as quickly and as correctly as possible. The test
ended after 35 trials or three consecutive incorrect answers.
We used accuracy (ratio of correct to all responses) as an
indicator of verbal knowledge. Data were missing from the
same two participants whose data were missing for the Identical Picture Task.
Working Memory for Spatial Location and Serial Order
We used a computerized version of a working memory task
for spatial location and serial order (Nagel et al., 2008),
wherein participants were shown a 4-by-4 grid of white circles on a blue background. For each of the 96 trials, four
(low working memory load level) or seven (high working

memory load level) circles were highlighted sequentially and
participants indicated whether a probed circle was among
those highlighted (working memory for spatial location).
If so, a digit (1–7) appeared in the center of this circle and
participants decided whether this digit matched the circle’s
position in the sequence (working memory for serial order).
Participants indicated their responses by pressing one of
two buttons (yes or no). Ratios of correct answers served as
accuracy measures for both subtasks. Due to data loss, one
older adult was excluded from the analysis of both subtasks,
and 13 older participants were excluded from the analysis of
the serial order memory subtask. A detailed description of
the missing data can be found in the Supplementary Materials. We performed Mann–Whitney U tests to compare
decision-making in older participants with complete versus
incomplete data on working memory for serial order, finding
no significant differences between the groups (all p > 0.16),
as detailed in our missing data statement in the Supplementary Information.
Perceptual Processing Speed
In the Identical Pictures Task, participants saw a black-andwhite line drawing in the upper part of the computer screen
and selected the matching drawing from five options below
by pressing a corresponding key (1–5) as quickly as possible. The test lasted 80 s. The mean response time served as
a parameter for perceptual speed. One young and one older
adult who did not comply with the task instructions were
excluded from the analyses. Data from one young and one
older participant were missing.

Correlates of Processing Noise
Processing noise can lead to less distinctive reward representation, affecting evaluation of risks and delayed rewards (Li
et al., 2007). We computed two measures of processing noise
reflecting response variability: The first was derived from
the Identical Pictures Task, where intra-individual reaction
time variability (standard deviation of reaction times) indicated cognitive fluctuations and neural noise. Three participants were excluded for this measure due to incomplete data.
The second measure, choice consistency parameter β,
was estimated using a softmax probability function from
the decision-making battery, with higher values reflecting
higher consistency in selecting options, and thus a higher
probability of taking more valuable offers (Pooseh et al.,
2018). The correlations between the averaged parameter and
the beta scores for each task range between 0.51 and 0.67
(Table S1), indicating that choice consistencies in the different tasks are highly associated. We were therefore able to
compute one parameter by averaging the mean-centered β

values from all four tasks, with lower consistency indicating
higher decision noise.

Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics (Version
25), applying a significance level of p < 0.05 for all tests.
Two-tailed t tests assessed differences between age groups.
We calculated Pearson’s bivariate and partial correlation
coefficients r and rp (correcting for age group) for associations among decision-making, cognitive, and noise variables. We used bootstrapping (5000 samples) to compute
bias-corrected accelerated 95% confidence intervals.
For significant correlations, we performed bootstrapping mediation analyses (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) using
the PROCESS macro for SPSS (http://​afhay​es.​com/​spss-​
sas-​and-​mplus-​macros-​and-​code.​html) with age group as
the independent variable (X), value-based decision-making
scores as dependent variables (Y), and noise or cognition
parameters as mediators (M). An illustration of the hypothetical mediation model is provided in Fig. 2. Coefficients
were calculated for each association, including the total
effect (c), the indirect effect (ab), and the direct effect (c’) of
age group on value-based decision-making. Path a indicates
the relationship between X and M, while b represents the
relationship between M and Y. Effect sizes were quantified
by applying Cohen´s d.

Results
Differences Between Age Groups
In decision-making (Fig. 3a, Table 1), older adults showed
higher delay discounting (t175 = − 3.01, p = 0.003) than
young adults, with a medium-sized effect (d = 0.45). Age

abilities represent the mediator in this model. Age group can either
have a direct effect (c’) on the dependent variable after accounting for
the mediator, or the influence of age group on the dependent variable

gains did not reach significance but trended higher among
older adults (t176 = − 1.82, p = 0.071, d = 0.27) than young
adults. Risk seeking for probabilistic losses (t176 = 0.73,
p = 0.467, d = 0.11) and loss aversion (t178 = 0.99, p = 0.322,
d = 0.15) did not significantly differ between groups.
Young adults outperformed older adults (p < 0.001) in all
tasks capturing fluid abilities (Fig. 3b, Table 1), including
working memory for spatial location (92% vs. 80% accuracy, d = 1.43) and serial order (80% vs. 60%, d = 1.33), and
processing speed (2.5 vs. 3.6 s, d = 1.90). As expected, the
older group exhibited greater accuracy in the Spot-a-Word
task (63% vs. 72%, p < 0.001, d = 0.76), which tests verbal
knowledge as a correlate of crystallized abilities.
Furthermore, older adults exhibited more noisy responses
than younger adults (Fig. 3c, Table 1), with increased reaction time variability in the Identical Pictures Task (740 ms
vs. 1106 ms, p < 0.0001, d = 1.06) and reduced decision consistency across the decision-making battery (0.24 vs. − 0.22,
p < 0.0001, d = 0.59).

Association Between Decision‑Making
and Cognitive/Noise Scores
To explore the relations between value-based decision-making, basic crystallized cognitive abilities (verbal knowledge),
fluid abilities (working memory, processing speed), and processing noise, we computed bivariate and partial (controlling for age group) correlation coefficients (Table 2). The
results indicated no significant associations between measures of decision-making and verbal knowledge or speed of
processing.
We determined the age-corrected correlations between
decision-making performance and cognitive abilities or
noise parameters, which are presented in Figure S1 of the
supplementary materials. Partial correlations with working
memory were significant between delay discounting and
working memory for spatial locations (rp = 0.171, n = 173)
as well as for risk seeking for losses and working memory
for serial order (rp = 0.183, n = 161). Regarding the correlates of processing noise, there were no significant associations between measures of decision-making and trial-by-trial
variability in the speed of processing (Identical Pictures)

task. However, higher processing noise (as operationalized
as lower choice consistency) across the decision-making battery was associated with better performance in delay discounting (rp = − 0.311, n = 175) and mixed gambles (loss
aversion) trials (rp = − 0.180, n = 178).

We found significant bivariate correlations between delay
discounting and decision consistency (r = − 0.352, n = 175),
between loss aversion and decision consistency (r = − 0.151,
n = 178), between risk aversion for gains and working memory for serial order (r = − 0.210, n = 162), and risk seeking
for losses and working memory for serial order (r = 0.180,
n = 162).

Mediation Analyses
To clarify whether choice consistency during decisionmaking or working memory for spatial location and serial
order influenced decision-making, we conducted mediation
analyses with the variables that were significantly zero-order
or partially (controlling for age group) correlated with valuebased decision-making parameters (Fig. 4). Older adults’
poorer performance in working memory for spatial location
(CI − 1.42 ≤ a ≤ − 0.93) was related to less delay discounting
(CI 0.03 ≤ b ≤ 0.38). The mediation model revealed an indirect relationship between age group and delay discounting
that is mediated by baseline working memory performance
(CI − 0.58 ≤ ab ≤ − 0.01). The differences between age
groups in delay discounting (CI 0.12 ≤ c ≤ 0.70) increased
when considering age differences in working memory for
spatial location (CI 0.30 ≤ c’ ≤ 1.00; model Fig. 4a), indicating a competitive mediation (Zhao et al., 2010). Decision
consistency fully mediated the age effect on delay discounting (CI 0.15 ≤ ab ≤ 0.73) by weakening the correlation (CI
0.15 ≤ c ≤ 0.73) between the age group and delay discounting
(CI: − 0.02 ≤ c’ ≤ 0.56; model Fig. 4b). When controlling
for both spatial working memory and decision consistency

in one partial correlation model, we found steeper delay
discounting in older adults (r = 0.231, p = 0.002, d = 0.47).
Working memory for serial order did not mediate the
association between age and probability discounting for
gains as indicated by the nonsignificant indirect path (CI:
− 0.00 ≤ ab ≤ 0.60; model Fig. 4c).
When probability discounting for losses and its potential mediators were examined, serial order memory (CI
− 0.48 ≤ ab ≤ − 0.02) showed significant indirect effects.
The numerical effect of age group on probability discounting for losses (CI − 0.40 ≤ c ≤ 0.21) reversed when serial
order memory was included (CI − 0.22 ≤ c’ ≤ 0.50; model
Fig. 4d), indicating a competitive mediation.
The mediation analysis of loss aversion via decision
consistency also revealed a significant indirect effect (CI
0.02 ≤ ab ≤ 0.22). The association between age group
and loss aversion (CI − 0.44 ≤ c ≤ 0.15) increased when
decision consistency was included as a mediator (CI
− 0.56 ≤ c’ ≤ 0.05; model Fig. 4e), but this increase was not
significant.
To further interpret the observed effects, we conducted
separate correlation analyses for each age group in models,
where competitive mediation effects were identified: In the
younger age group, better spatial working memory was associated with higher delay discounting (r = 0.323, p = 0.003,
CI 0.092; 0.507), a relationship that was not observed in
older adults (r = 0.128, p = 0.231, CI − 0.069; 0.377). In
contrast, in the older age group, higher decision consistency
was linked to lower loss aversion (r = − 0.235, p = 0.024, CI
− 0.420; − 0.039), while this association did not appear in
the younger age group (r = − 0.086, p = 0.434, CI − 0.284;

Discussion
This study explored potential differences between healthy
young and older adults in decision-making, specifically in
delay discounting, risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for
losses, and loss aversion, thereby taking aging-related differences in cognition, especially in fluid cognitive abilities,
and in behavioral indices of processing noise into account.
Among 179 participants, older adults exhibited steeper delay
discounting than young adults. Regarding the covariates for
fluid cognitive abilities and processing noise, we replicated
the expected age effect of lower spatial working memory,
higher trial-by-trial response variability, and lower decision consistency in older adults compared to young adults.
Exploratory mediation analyses indicated that lower decision consistency and better spatial working memory promoted steeper discounting, but these analyses also indicated
robust age differences even when controlling for both mediators. We further observed a slight trend towards higher risk
aversion for gains in older adults but no differences in risk
seeking for losses and loss aversion, even when adjusting for
cognitive abilities and processing noise. The lack of a clear
age difference in those three tasks is in line with the recent
meta-analysis by Bagaïni and colleagues (Bagaïni et al.,
2023), which also reported nonsignificant effects of age on
these decision-making parameters. In the following, we will
therefore focus on the mediating effects of processing noise
as indicated by choice consistency during decision-making
and working memory capacity on the observed adult age
differences in delay discounting.
Choice consistency fully mediated age differences in
delay discounting such that age differences decreased when
taking choice consistency into account. Lower choice consistency might be explained by increased processing noise in
older adults (Li & Sikström, 2002; Li et al., 2001a, 2001b;
MacDonald et al., 2009; Pachur et al., 2017), which impedes
the evaluation of complex options’ overall utility, leading
older individuals to focus on simpler or more immediate
options (Burks et al., 2009). Increased processing noise in
older adults might reduce the specificity of value representations and thereby bias choice behavior towards computationally less demanding (i.e., immediate) choice options.
This bias in choice behavior in older individuals may have
important real-life implications for various decision-making
domains, affecting economics, finances, health, social, and
political topics.

effect (c’), and the indirect effect (ab) of age group on value-based decision-making

We further observed a competitive mediation of age group
via spatial working memory on delay discounting, suggesting
that if both groups had had equal spatial working memory performance, the age difference would have been even larger. We
found that in younger adults, better spatial working memory
was significantly associated with higher delay discounting,
implying that in younger individuals a more effective spatial working memory shifts their decision-making behavior
towards more prioritization of immediate rewards over future
ones. Conversely, the absence of a similar relationship in older
adults suggests that the influence of spatial working memory
on discounting diminishes with age. One possible explanation is that even older adults with above-average working
memory capacity may be unable to allocate sufficient cognitive resources to enhance their decision-making performance.
This limitation could stem from an overall decline in working
memory capacity, which hinders their ability to compensate
for the increased noise observed in their decision-making processes. Our finding of the association between higher spatial
working memory and steeper delay discounting contradicts
previous findings showing an inverse relation between working memory and delay discounting (Aranovich et al., 2016;
Finn et al., 2015; Shamosh et al., 2008; Szuhany et al., 2018).
This discrepancy might in part be related to the use of different tasks. We applied a visuospatial working memory task,

whereas previous studies tested verbal working memory in
retaining information while doing arithmetic (Finn et al., 2015)
or n-back tasks (Aranovich et al., 2016; Szuhany et al., 2018).
However, this shows that spatial working memory plays a role
in this process by supporting the maintenance and manipulation of the information necessary for evaluating the delayed
reward, which is a cognitive process that is involved in various
decision-making tasks. Importantly, age differences persisted
even when both mediators, working memory and processing
noise, were considered. This result could indicate that other
psychological mechanisms could play an important role in
addition to neurodegeneration-related mechanisms. Possible
causes contributing to age differences might also be related
to motivational factors or recognition of the finite nature of
life in old age. Understanding that age differences in delay
discounting may even persist when accounting for mediators
highlights the complexity of the underlying processes as well
as the influence of individual differences in covariate measures
on decision-making across the lifespan. However, the effect
size found in our study (d = 0.47) is substantially greater and of
opposite direction compared to the very recent meta-analysis
by Bagaïni and colleagues (2023). One reason may be that our
sample of older participants is not representative of the general
older population given our strict screening process, but rather
applies to high-functioning older adults.

Value‑Based Decision‑Making and Its Relation to Cognition and Processing Noise in Young and…

Of note, both higher processing noise (i.e., lower
choice consistency) and lower spatial working memory
in older adults may reflect lower dopamine receptor density (MacDonald et al., 2012) and dopamine tone (Störmer
et al., 2012), which decrease with age (Karrer et al., 2017;
Samanez-Larkin et al., 2010). Dopamine appears to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus reduce processing noise
(Bäckman et al., 2010; MacDonald et al., 2012). Together,
these studies support the claim that deterioration within the
dopamine system may cause changes in behavior during
aging (Bäckman et al., 2006).

Limitations
The cross-sectional design of this study precludes causal
claims about the effects of age on decision-making and renders the results susceptible to cohort effects. For example,
we did not control for factors such as income, which might
be relevant in the context of our decision-making battery, so
we can only speculate about possible differences between
groups that are unrelated to age. Additionally, our task
did not systematically manipulate the variation in delays
(3–365 days) and in rewards (€3–50) between participants,
and did not compare potential domain-specific adult age differences in delay discounting (e.g., Jimura et al., 2011). Furthermore, the ecological validity of our task may be rather
limited, rendering our results to some extent measure-specific. We focused on basic cognitive abilities and processing noise as potential mediators of age effects on decisionmaking, and did not consider individual differences with
regard to personality traits, socioemotional or other factors
that might also be of relevance.
Due to non-response and sampling biases (as evident, for
example, from the to be expected low response rate during
recruitment and the necessity of rather strict exclusion criteria), our sample is non-representative, with our older adults
likely being higher functioning than the general older population. In addition, a sensitivity analysis (G*Power, Version
3.1.9.6) indicated that our sample size is only sufficient to
detect an effect size of d = 0.42 with 80% power. Studies
in larger samples with less rigorous exclusion criteria and
therefore fewer limitations with regard to representativeness are needed to extend our conclusions towards a broader
population.

Conclusion
Our study contributes to the recent body of literature suggesting that age effects on decision-making, when comparing healthy young and older adults, are small (see also the
recent meta-analysis by Bagaïni et al., 2023). Our study
further highlights that adult age differences might in part

depend on the decision-making domain and task, and are
presumably also affected by individual differences in baseline cognitive function and processing noise (as reflected
in the consistency of choice behavior). Of specific interest,
our results indicate that older adults’ less consistent choice
behavior and poorer working memory performance might
bias their decision behavior towards higher discounting rates
in some tasks, resulting in a robust age effect on delay discounting in our sample. Although our study lacks sufficient
representativeness, it might stimulate future studies that
further elucidate individual differences in decision-making
across the adult lifespan.
