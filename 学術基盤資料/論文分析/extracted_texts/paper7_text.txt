Abstract
As new technical paradigms like electronic democracy and e-governance have emerged quickly, large-scale group decisionmaking (LSGDM) has become a significant area of research. In LSGDM, conflicting interests and divergent viewpoints
have grown especially widespread, making it challenging to bring individual preferences into line with a productive group
consensus. This paper uses the concept of information granules to design a granular LSGDM consensus framework that
addresses two core aspects of LSGDM: the clustering process and the consensus reaching process. First, granular hierarchical
clustering is designed based on the principle of justifiable granularity, with a novel division index introduced to determine the
optimal number of subgroups. Next, the fuzzy consensus measure is defined by the specificity and coverage of information
granule, and a two-stage granule consensus model is proposed by integrating the maximum consensus rule and minimum
consensus cost to optimize individual opinions and achieve an efficient group consensus. Finally, an illustrative example with
detailed experiments is conducted to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the granular LSGDM consensus model
in enhancing consensus and group division among DMs.

Introduction
Group decision-making (GDM) is crucial for addressing
practical problems, as it incorporates the diverse perspectives
of different decision-makers (DMs) to arrive at reasonable
decision results. GDM considers the preferences of DMs to
identify the ideal solution from a set of possible alternatives
[1], with the final solution derived from the adjusted preference information of the group members. Currently, GDM has
been widely applied in fields such as connected autonomous

vehicles [2], supply chain investment [3], renewable energy
[4], medical diagnosis [5], and emergency plans making [6].
The traditional method of having DMs participate in live
activities and numerically express their choices has evolved
into more diverse and complex forms of interaction. With
advancements in network technology and the widespread
use of social media, DMs can now engage in the decisionmaking process through multiple channels, leading to the
emergence of large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM).
If the number of DMs involved in solving a decision problem exceeds 20, it may be classified as an LSGDM problem
[7]. However, there are two challenges associated with the
implementation of LSGDM. One challenges is managing a
large number of participants and their inputs, which can be
quite intricate and time-consuming. Another is that the effectiveness of decision-making in LSGDM can be influenced by
various factors, including the level of expertise and knowledge of the participants, as well as the potential for biases
and groupthink.
To address LSGDM issues, it is crucial to establish a
decision-making model that considers both individual perspectives and group opinions. The ultimate aim is to enhance

the effectiveness of GDM and overall group satisfaction
by identifying potential problems and achieving consensus
or agreement. Currently, numerous approaches have been
established to address LSGDM issues [8–12]. The LSGDM
resolution typically consists of two significant processes
[13]: (1) The group clustering process seeks to divide numerous DMs into smaller groups to reduce the complexity and
cost of LSGDM. (2) The consensus reaching process (CRP)
enables DMs to adjust their preferences or those of their
groups, contributing to higher satisfaction with the final outcome.
In the clustering process, DMs can be categorized into
several subgroups based on their individual preferences. The
goal is to group DMs by their similarities, ensuring that those
with similar opinions are placed in the same group. Various
clustering algorithms have been designed to categorize DMs
in LSGDM problems. Liang et al. [14] proposed a novel
clustering model based on opinion similarity and trust relationships among DMs, maximizing the combined cohesion
of the subgroups. Ding et al. [15] developed a conflictrelationship-based clustering method to effectively address
opinion conflicts in LSGDM. Liang et al. [16] presented a
clustering method based on the similarity-trust score between
DMs to reduce the complexity of decision-making. Wang et
al. [17] designed a dual-attribute affinity propagation algorithm to divide the large group into manageable subgroups.
Peng and Chen [18] proposed a clustering method based on
the picture fuzzy Chi-square similarity measure to reduce the
complexity and costs associated with the decision-making
process. Tang et al. [19] applied the K-medoids clustering
algorithm to cluster DMs into multiple subgroups, aiming to
reduce the dimension of the problem. Yang et al. [20] offered
a two-stage clustering approach that groups DMs by objectively selecting initial cluster centers based on the number
of supporters and the separations between DMs. The aforementioned works highlight how existing clustering methods
simplify the LSGDM problems and offer a direct approach
to identifying similar preference within the LSGDM framework.
Differences in cognition, background, experience and
expertise among DMs lead to variations in their evaluation
of alternatives, often resulting in a lack of consensus among
DMs and hindering the achievement of a universally accepted
solution. Consequently, the initial preference aggregation
may only be acceptable to a subset of DMs [21]. To address
this, CRP must be implemented to enhance consensus among
DMs, ensuring broader acceptance of the final result [22].
CRP is a dynamic, iterative group negotiation process that
guides DMs towards consensus [23]. By adjusting DMs’
preferences, their perspectives can be better aligned, facilitating the establishment of a high-level consensus before
making a group decision.

However, consensus adjustment is both time-consuming
and resource-intensive, requiring low-cost adjustment strategy. Many studies have focused on narrowing the preference
gaps among DMs and achieving consensus, considering the
challenges of time and resource limitations. Xing et al. [24]
established an incentive-based minimum adjustment consensus model by developing a trust-relationship-driven incentive
mechanism to generate recommendations for individual preference. Yuan et al. [25] designed a budget-constrained
consensus framework to reduce group conflict to address
non-cooperative behaviors. Meng et al. [26] used the Gini
coefficient to measure the fairness of consensus adjustment
and proposed a two-stage consensus mechanism to minimize both consensus adjustment and ensure fairness while
respecting minority opinions. Wang et al. [27] established a
feedback adjustment model that minimizes individual adjustment cost and maximizes group consensus. Ma et al. [28]
utilized a visual adjustment path in the maximum expert
consensus model to avoid over-adjusted individual opinions
and facilitate consensus formation. Feng et al. [29] offered
the minimum cost consensus model, considering altruismfairness preferences within a social trust network to enhance
DMs’ satisfaction. Qin et al. [30] developed a social networkdriven bi-level minimum cost consensus model, focusing on
the interactions between the moderator and DMs, as well as
among DMs themselves.
The aforementioned analysis suggests that the clustering
process and CRP offer valuable insights. However, several
unsolved problems persist in practical LSGDM, especially
when the number of DMs reaches the hundreds or thousands.
These issues can be summarized as follows:

1) In the clustering process, methods that rely on a predefined number of subgroups often struggle with large-scale
data. While traditional techniques, such as the elbow
method and silhouette coefficient, can help determine
the number of subgroups, they primarily focus on data
patterns and lack the ability to quantify trade-offs among
multiple objectives, such as consensus levels among DMs
and conflicts of interest. Additionally, existing clustering methods are primarily designed for decision-making
groups of up to 50 individuals and have not yet been
validated for decision problems involving thousands of
participants.
2) In consensus measurement, distance functions are commonly used to measure the consensus level. However,
different distance functions can produce varying results
during the CRP and can influence the convergence speed
in distinct ways. Currently, there is no benchmark to
determine which distance function performs best in practical applications, creating challenges in selecting the

Complex & Intelligent Systems

appropriate distance function and ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of consensus measurement.
Granular computing (GrC) is a new paradigm extracting knowledge for complex data, providing a highly abstract
data modeling strategy. Recently, integrating GrC with group
decision-making problems offers a potential way for constructing CRP models [31, 32]. Research in references [31,
33, 34] indicates that information granules, as entries for preference information, contribute to achieving group consensus.
Additionally, the group opinion derived from traditional
aggregation operators is often susceptible to the influence
of outliers. To mitigate this influence and to describe the
consensus level among groups more flexibly, this study proposes the granular LSGDM (G-LSGDM) consensus model
for aggregating preference information, measuring the consensus degree, and implementing the consensus feedback
mechanism. Specifically, information granules are generated
by introducing coverage and specificity, guided by the principle of justifiable granularity [35], and then the aggregation
method and the consensus measurement function based on
information granularity are designed. This method allows for
the description of group opinions and illustrate the proximity between individual opinions and the group opinion. The
main contributions of the G-LSGDM consensus model can
be categorized into three aspects.
1.) During the clustering process, we develop a granular hierarchical clustering method that leverages local and global
consensus levels to create a division index for determining the number of subgroups. Additionally, we introduce
a granular aggregation method that generates valuable
information granules representing group opinions and
reduces outliers.
2.) We create a fuzzy consensus measurement method that
prioritizes the quality of the consensus granule from a
GrC perspective. This method describes the level of consensus attained and provides flexible control over the
number of DMs needed to reach consensus.
3.) A two-stage consensus model is developed for balancing moderator costs with consensus level, resulting in an
efficient and cost-effective consensus.
The organization of this study is below. Section Preliminaries provides an overview of granular computing and the
consensus model. Section Granular large-scale group decision making consensus model presents a detailed explanation
of the G-LSGDM consensus model, including clustering
process, information aggregation process, and consensus
reaching process. In Section Example, a case study on awarding honours to outstanding graduates is used to illustrate
the presented granular LSGDM model. Section Comparison

analysis provides a detailed comparative discussion of the
proposed consensus model. Section Conclusion concludes
the study with a summary of the research findings and suggestions for future research.

Preliminaries
This section reviews some basic concepts and definitions
associated with the design of G-LSGDM.

Interval fuzzy number
Fuzzy interval numbers are a valuable tool for reflecting the
uncertainty in DMs’ preferences. By using interval fuzzy
numbers, DMs can articulate their preferences in a way
that considers the uncertainty associated with the evaluation
objectives.

Definitoin 1 [36] Interval number is defined as p = p − , p +
= {y | p − ≤ y ≤ p + }, where p − and p + represent the lower
and upper boundaries of the interval defined by p.

Principle of justifiable granularity
Information granule is element factors in granular computing, which can take on different forms, such as numerical,
symbolic, linguistic, or perceptual. The local structures of
complex data can be represented and comprehended by
breaking them down into meaningful information granules,
which can then be combined to form a higher-level hierarchical structure. This process creates a global and more
abstract description that reveals the data structures. Pedrycz
[38] proposed the principle of justifiable granularity, which
offers guidelines on how to generate information granules.
The focus of this principle is on two conflicting requirements:
coverage and specificity, and seeks to balance them in order
to achieve optimal results.

1) Coverage, denoted by Cov, indicates the coverage degree
of an information granule. The value of Cov increases
with the size of the information granule.
2) Specificity Sp is a measure of the compactness of an
information granule, where its value decreases as the size
of the information granule increases.

is true, it indicates that the group has achieved consensus. If
this condition does not hold for a specific issue, DMs are
required to adjust their individual preferences or opinions to
reach a higher consensus level. The minimum cost consensus
model is proposed below,

In practical applications, the determination of Cov and
Sp can take various forms. Cov is typically treated as a
function that increases with the cardinality of information
granules, while Sp is defined as a function that decreases with
the size of the information granules. As coverage increases,
specificity generally decreases. Higher values of both specificity and coverage suggest better quality of the information
granules. Therefore, we need to find a compromise in the
granule generation. The given information granule should not
only cover the preferences of the DMs as much as possible,
but also comprehensively reflect the preference information
of each DM. The preference information granule can be
obtained by maximizing the product of its specificity and
coverage,

min

The objective of the maximum expert consensus model
(MECM) is to determine the optimal number of DMs that
can reach a consensus while remaining within a specific
cost threshold. Similarly, the MECM [41] is extended and
expressed below,

Q = Cov · Sp.

max

(1)

As the value of Q increases, the information granules
become more effective in terms of coverage and specificity.
The principle of justifiable granularity can guide the granulation of preference information at different abstract levels,
providing a range for adjustment [32]. In this study, the
generated information granules offer a more comprehensive
description and interpretation of subgroup preference information.

Granular aggregation method
In this study, the individual preferences of DMs are granulated to describe subgroups and assist in aggregating information from different subgroups. Rather than relying on single
values, the designed granular aggregation method leverages
information granules to represent the essential information
regarding DMs’ preferences within subgroups.
In this study, preference information granule qihj =

cihj − rihj , cihj + rihj is created to represent the aggregated
preference information of alternative ai regarding attribute b j
in subgroup ch . The terms cihj and rihj represent the midpoint

to control the radius range.

{rihj , cihj }opt = arg max Q(rihj , cihj ),
where the term Q(rihj , cihj ) refers to the quality of the preference information granule qihj ,
Q(rihj , cihj ) = Covihj · Spihj ,

Granular hierarchical clustering

Selecting the number of clusters

The hierarchical clustering method (HCM) is a widely used
approach for clustering data without requiring the number
of clusters to be determined beforehand. It relies on distance
measures and connection types to generate various clustering
results. The use of HCM helps break down LSGDM problems
into smaller, more manageable subgroups, facilitating a more
effective decision-making process. By addressing each subproblem separately, we can achieve local solutions that can
be combined to derive the overall solution.
This study introduces the granular hierarchical clustering method (G-HCM), which combines granular computing
with hierarchical clustering to investigate group division and
aggregate preference information in LSGDM. The principle
of justifiable granularity is suitable for guiding the granulation of preference information at different abstract levels,
thereby enabling the exploration of a two-stage consensusreaching model that incorporates granular computing.

Considering the ultimate goal of achieving consensus among
subgroup members in LSGDM, a new division index is
proposed to determine the number of subgroups based on
two essential components: the global consensus level Gcon,
derived from subgroup clustering outcomes, and the consensus level within subgroups in_con h (h = 1, 2, · · · , N −l), as
given in Eq. (10) and Eq. (6), respectively. By comparing the
division index across different potential subgroup partitions,
the optimal number of subgroups can be determined.
Let N represent the number of layers of pedigree chart of
clustering, C I (l) represent the division index corresponding
to the l-th layer (l = 1, 2, · · · , N ),

G-HCM
G-HCM measures the distance between two subgroups based
on aggregation information. The distance d(u, v) between

where Gcon(l) represents the global consensus level of the
clustering result on the l-th layer, and in_con h (l) represents
the consensus level within subgroup ch on the l-th layer, λ
is the penalty coefficient. Larger subgroups are more capable of capturing common opinions and preferences, thereby
minimizing the impact of different individual views on group
preference information. In smaller subgroups, the opinions
and information of DMs can significantly influence decision
results, increasing the complexity of the CRP. By maintaining larger subgroups, the influence of information among
different DMs is balanced, which helps reduce the influence
of information bias on clustering results.
The weight adjustment parameter β aims to balance the
influence of global consensus level and the consensus level
within subgroups on the division index in solving LSGDM
problems. By adjusting the value of β, the weights of Gcon
and in_con h in clustering results can be controlled. When
β has a smaller value, in_con h has a greater impact on
the division index, resulting in clustering results that prioritize the preservation of distinct characteristics among
subgroups. Conversely, when β has a larger value, Gcon
has a significantly impact on the division index, highlighting the importance of group consensus levels among all
DMs. By selecting and adjusting the value of β based on
the requirements of LSGDM, a better balance between Gcon
and in_con h can be achieved to obtain more reasonable group
division results. We choose the one with the highest value by
calculating the division index C I (l) for the clustering results
in the pedigree chart.

This study assesses DMs’ agreement on collective preference
information form two perspectives: the representativeness of
collective preference with respect to DMs’ preferences and
the reliability of aggregated preference information.
The consensus level within subgroups and the global consensus level serve as indicators of the agreement and consent
among DMs regarding the aggregated subgroup and global
preference information, which impacts the entire decisionmaking process. The steps for measuring consensus level are
outlined below.

Given a predefined consensus threshold δ, two scenarios
can be distinguished:
1 Gcon ≥ δ indicates that DMs reach an agreement

without changing the preference information.
2 Gcon < δ indicates that DMs do not have an acceptable

agreement, hence consensus adjustment process should be
implemented.
Consensus adjustment process
During the consensus adjustment process, DMs strive to
minimize their adjustment expenses while achieving their
goals. This stems from the rational belief that lower costs are
preferable. Consequently, this study proposes a two-stage
consensus adjustment model based on granular computing.
The first stage is to determine whether a predefined consensus
threshold can be reached, while the second stage focuses on
identifying the adjustment strategy to minimize adjustment
costs.
The first stage: maximum granular consensus model
(MGCM)
In the two-stage consensus model, prioritizing the local
adjustment strategy over the global adjustment can improve
efficiency. The key is to initially create identification rules to
select the specific alternatives and attributes requiring adjustment. The set of local positions to be adjusted is expressed
as S N A,


S N A = (i, j) | Gcon i j < Gcon .

(11)

The preferences for certain specific locations are modified
based on the set S N A to improve the consensus level during
the first stage of the two-stage consensus adjustment model.

where Gcon stands for the global consensus level of the
adjusted preference information for subgroup ch .
There are two possible results after completing the first
adjustment step:
1 Gcon < δ means that the minimum consensus cost

adjustment is disregarded, and the adjusted preference information is aggregated and sorted to obtain the final decision
result.
2 Gcon ≥ δ means that an adjustment strategy is

required to reduce costs and proceed to the second stage.
The second stage: minimum cost adjustment model
(MCAM)
In the two-stage adjustment model, the composition of
unit adjustment costs includes variable costs and fixed costs.
The variable costs are closely related to the consensus level
within subgroups. As the consensus level increases, variable
costs exhibit a downward trend.
Definitoin 4 Let AC h denote the unit adjustment cost of subgroup ch , and its calculation is shown as follows,
AC h = (1 − in_con h ) · n h + FC,
where in_con h represents the consensus level within ch , (1−
in_con h ) · n h means the variable unit adjustment cost of ch ,
FC represents the fixed cost required to adjust the subgroup
preference information.
The MCAM is utilized to determine the most effective
adjustment strategy, while ensuring low adjustment costs and
meeting the consensus requirements. The MCAM is developed as Model 2,

After obtaining the adjusted results of the two-stage
adjustment model, the alternatives undergo a process to determine their priority degree, which are then used for ranking
and determining the final choice.

Example
During the selection process for outstanding graduates at
ABC University, one student distinguished himself/herself
among seven candidates and was awarded the honor of Outstanding Graduate. The event involves 1,000 participants,
including teachers, students and alumni, garnering significant attention and support. The evaluation process involves a
comprehensive assessment of candidates’ scientific research
capabilities (b1 ), social practice experiences (b2 ), and ideological character (b3 ). However, each participant has their
own standards for evaluating a candidate’s excellence, which
introduced a degree of subjectivity into the evaluation process. To ensure fairness and objectivity, the evaluation also
required that each candidate receive corresponding objective
scores.
The teachers and students involved in the evaluation are
denoted by the set {e1 , e2 , e3 , · · · , e1000 }. The seven candidates who advanced to the final selection are denoted as
{a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , a6 , a7 }. Furthermore, the three evaluation

criteria are denoted by the set {b1 , b2 , b3 }. In light of the principle of fairness, it is essential to emphasize that all DMs are
regarded as equally significant in this evaluation process. The
preference information provided by the DMs is expressed in
the form of interval values, which are presented in Table 1.
In addition to the criteria and alternatives, it is essential to assign values to the following parameters, consensus
threshold: δ = 0.82, control parameter: α = 1, adjustment
parameter: β = 0.75, penalty coefficient: λ = 10−4 , fixed
cost: FC = 2.
The following are the specific steps for deriving the optimal alternative using the proposed method.
Step 1: The clustering process
Using the division index C I (l), the optimal number of
subgroups for clustering the 1,000 DMs is determined to be
36, as shown in Fig. 2. Table 2 lists the number of DMs in
each subgroup.
Step 2: Consensus degree measurement
The global consensus level is calculated using Eq. (10),
resulting in a value of Gcon = 0.765. Since Gcon < δ, the
two-stage feedback adjustment is applied to adjust the initial
preference information.
Step 3: Two-stage feedback adjustment process
First, the positions that need adjustment are identified
using Eq. (11), with S N A specified as,

S N A = (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 2),

(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3) .

Fig. 2 Group Division Index

Second, Model 1 is employed to adjust the preference
information for the specified positions, resulting in an
updated group consensus level of Gcon = 0.85. Since
Gcon > δ, we focus on minimizing adjustment costs while
ensuring that the group consensus level remains within an
acceptable range, thereby entering the second adjustment
stage.
In the second adjustment stage, the cost of adjusting the
subgroups is calculated using Definition 4, as shown in Table
3. Meanwhile, Model 2 is employed to adjust the initial preference information of the subgroups. The updated consensus
level is Gcon = 0.822 > δ, and the adjustment cost is 34.4.
Step 4: Selection process
First, we employ the granular aggregation method described
in Section Granular aggregation method to aggregate the final
preference information obtained from each DMs within the
subgroups, as illustrated in Table 4.
Second, the overall preference information is aggregated,
as shown in Table 5.
Finally, the comparison matrix C M and the priority
degree ADi for alternative ai can be calculated as follows:
AD1 = 1.063, AD2 = 1.469, AD3 = 1.268, AD4 =
1.259, AD5 = 1.321, AD6 = 1.334, AD7 = 2.785. The

sisting of a single alternative and its attributes, to analyze the
impact of different parameter values on the proposed granular aggregation method.
The size of the interval information granule is significantly
influenced by the parameter α. As illustrated in Fig. 3, raising
α within a particular range results in a higher level of group
consensus, showing that members’ viewpoints are more in
line with others. However, when aggregating group preference information, it is essential to adhere to the principle of
justifiable granularity. Once the parameter α exceeds a certain threshold, the consensus level remains stable, even as
α continues to rise. The δ represents the specified consensus
threshold, which plays a crucial role in the LSGDM. Changes

Fig. 3 The influence of α and δ

in δ directly affect the group’s consensus adjustment cost, as
illustrated in Fig. 3. When the consensus threshold is set to
a relatively low value (e.g., δ = 0.2), there is no need to
modify any preference information within the group. Consequently, in this scenario, an acceptable consensus level is
achieved among group members regarding the existing preference information, resulting in an adjustment cost of 0.
In this section, we employ a traditional information aggregation method, the weighted average (WA) operator, to
aggregate global preferences for comparative analysis. The

where ωi = m1 is the weight of subgroup ci . In Fig. 4, there
are two intervals: interval I and interval II, representing two
different results of preference information aggregation methods. The former is generated using the granular aggregation
method, while the latter employs the traditional WA aggregation operator. The similarity between these two intervals
and their corresponding initial preference information can
be determined using Definition 3. The similarity degree for
interval I is 0.52, whereas that for interval II is 0.5. These
findings indicate that the aggregation result produced by the
proposed method exhibits a suitable representative pattern,
providing a solid foundation for future research and decisionmaking.
Figure 5 shows that when the group contains DMs with
extreme preferences, their preference information (Interval
II) can influence the aggregated result, skewing it in favor
of those with extreme preferences. Specifically, the similarity degree for Interval I remains steady at 0.52, while the
similarity degree for Interval II experiences a slight decline
to 0.48. The similarity degree between the aggregated preference information and the initial preference information for
Interval I remains constant at 0.52, indicating the stability

through simulation studies. To further highlight the superiority of the clustering method proposed in this paper, we
conducted a comparative analysis of the G-HCM and traditional HCM methods, examining the division indices and
consensus levels for different subgroup numbers. The results
are presented in Fig. 6.
The results shown in Fig. 6(a) indicate that the HCM
method performs better when the number of clusters ranges
from 10 to 27. However, when the number of participants
in the decision-making process exceeds 1000, this range of
clusters does not significantly reduce the complexity of the
decision-making problem, as each cluster still contains a relatively large number of DMs. In contrast, when the number of
clusters exceeds 27, the effectiveness of the G-HCM method
becomes more apparent. Furthermore, the G-HCM method
considers aggregated preference information, allowing for
the integration of diverse perspectives. This helps mitigate
the influence of extreme individual opinions, ultimately leading to more objective and reliable group division outcomes.
Fig. 6(b) illustrates that the overall consensus level obtained
by the G-HCM method is higher, indicating that the decision results from this method will be more widely accepted
and yield greater satisfaction. Additionally, Fig. 6(c) shows
that when the number of DMs exceeds 1000, the G-HCM
method can significantly enhance the consensus level within
each subgroup.

of the proposed method. In contrast, the similarity degree
between the aggregated preference information generated
using the WA method and the initial preference information for Interval II decreases from 0.50 to 0.48, reflecting its
sensitivity to extreme preferences. Overall, these results indicate that the granular aggregation method effectively filters
out extreme preferences and reduces the impact of outliers
on decision-making results, thereby ensuring the robustness
and reliability of the proposed method.

Comparison analysis
To examine the effectiveness of the G-LSGDM consensus
model in the clustering process, we utilize the experimental
data provided in Section Example to compare the G-HCM
clustering algorithm with the traditional HCM clustering
algorithm.
The effectiveness of granular aggregation methods in
managing extreme preference information has been analyzed

123

This section presents a comparative analysis of various
decision-making models. By comparing the G-LSGDM consensus model with existing methods, the unique advantages
and efficacy of the G-LSGDM consensus model are assessed.
Table 6 offers a detailed comparison.
For solving LSGDM problems, clustering algorithms
simplify the decision-making process for complex groups.
However, some algorithms [20, 44] require predetermined
cluster numbers, which have significant limitations that make
it challenging to accurately reflect group structures and may
introduce subjective bias, potentially reducing the reliability of the results. This study presents a granular hierarchical
clustering method that utilizes preference distribution information and consensus levels to determine the optimal number
of subgroups, thereby minimizing the influence of individual
preferences and enhancing the rationality of the results.
The weighted average operator [17, 42–44] is the most
commonly used technique for aggregating preference information in addressing LSGDM problems. However, this
method may be sensitive to outliers in practical applications.
In contrast, the granular aggregation method proposed in this
study offers a more flexible approach that effectively summarizes and describes collective opinions at a higher level
of abstraction, while also helping to mitigate the influence

The indicator “–” indicates that the corresponding item is not considered

of outliers, thereby enhancing the stability of the decisionmaking process.
In the CRP, the process is generally divided into two
stages: the consensus measurement stage and the feedback
adjustment stage. On one hand, existing methods [17, 42–
44] typically assess the consensus level by measuring the
distance between DMs’ preference information; however,
different distance functions may yield varying results. On
the other hand, the feedback adjustment stage involves modifying individual preferences. Some studies [16, 42, 43]
have adopted a global adjustment strategy, which can lead
to the loss of initial information and make the adjustment

process more time-consuming. This study designs a fuzzy
consensus measurement method within a granular computing framework that offers flexibility and applicability, as
group consensus levels can be derived from the diverse specificity and coverage of information granules. Furthermore, the
proposed two-stage consensus model provides more precise
local information adjustments, ensuring that DMs achieve
satisfactory results while preserving their initial perspectives
as much as possible.
Compared to the feedback adjustment strategy proposed
in references [16, 17, 42–44], the developed two-stage adjustment model integrates the principles of maximum consensus

123

329

and minimum cost adjustment, with the goal of achieving an
effective group consensus, thereby improving the acceptance
and satisfaction of the decision-making results.
In summary, our method offers significant advantages
over existing approaches and provides potential solutions
for practical applications. However, it also has certain limitations. First, with the growth of social media, the number
of participants in decision-making problems has increased
exponentially, leading to greater divergence of opinions
among stakeholders, as well as more pronounced competitive
and non-cooperative behaviors. Future research should incorporate these behaviors into consensus models. Second, given
the differences among DMs in terms of knowledge structure, individual preferences, and information representation
(such as numerical, interval, and linguistic formats) within
LSGDM, establishing a consensus model that effectively
integrates heterogeneous evaluation information becomes
crucial for addressing the practical challenges of LSGDM.

Conclusion
This study introduces the concept of information granules to design the G-LSGDM consensus framework, aiming
to achieve more satisfactory decision-making results in
LSGDM. Additionally, we provide an example to illustrate
the specific application of the proposed method and compare
it with traditional methods to demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed model in terms of consensus and clustering,
especially in decision-making processes involving thousands
of participants. The main innovations and theoretical contributions of this study are summarized as follows,
• 1) For the clustering process, we construct a granular hierarchical clustering approach based on the principle of
justifiable granularity, where the division index is used
to determine the optimal number of subgroups. Additionally, we develop a granular aggregation method that
generates information granules representing group opinions and helps eliminate outliers.
• 2) For the group consensus measurement process, we
define the fuzzy consensus measure function by considering both the coverage and specificity of information
granules. This function offers flexibility and applicability due to the diverse expression functions used for the
specificity and coverage of the consensus granules.
• 3) For the information adjustment process, we incorporate the moderator’s decision cost into the feedback
mechanism and propose a two-stage granule consensus

model that reduces adjustment costs while ensuring the
DMs’ satisfaction with the final solution.
In LSGDM, the individual behaviors of DMs, including
non-cooperative and manipulative behaviors, directly impact
both the decision-making results and the efficiency of the
CRP. Therefore, constructing a consensus feedback mechanism that considers the individual behavior of DMs in the
CRP is promising. Additionally, exploring the allocation of
information granularity in LSGDM presents another intriguing direction. In our proposed model, we primarily focus on
interval-based information granules. In the future, we will
explore other forms of information granules, such as type2 fuzzy sets, to characterize the uncertainty in the process
of decision making activities and examine their impact on
decision results. Furthermore, the proposed model can be
applied to other relevant fields, such as Hospital-based Health
Technology Assessment, to help hospitals evaluate the value
and effectiveness of new technologies, thereby enhancing the
quality and efficiency of medical services.
