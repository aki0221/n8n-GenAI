ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

In group decision making, human experts are usually susceptible to cognitive biases and
information overload. Artificial intelligence (AI) has capabilities in data processing and ana­
lysis, but is limited by issues such as interpretability and human adoption. Humans and AI
have different problem-solving capabilities, they can benefit from each other. Thus, there is
a need to leverage a mechanism to tap into the intelligence of both parties and achieve
mutually shared outcomes. In this study, we propose a large-scale group decision-making
model with human-AI consensus. First, an improved density-peak clustering algorithm is uti­
lized to classify experts into subgroups based on the Similarity-Trust-Attitude score. Then,
weights of experts and subgroups are obtained based on the internal influence of experts
and the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy of subgroup preferences. Further, considering three dif­
ferent strategies of human-AI interaction, subgroup consensus and subgroup-AI consensus
are calculated. Finally, a minimum cost consensus model with heterogeneous feedback strat­
egies is proposed. The usability of the proposed model is verified through a medical diagno­
sis case. This study found that the human-AI coordination with heterogeneous feedback
strategies can reduce adjustment costs, and different interaction mechanisms have different
effects.

1. Introduction
Group decision making (GDM) aims to facilitate the
optimal ranking of a set of alternatives to a specific
problem through the collaborative effort of multiple
experts (Meng et al., 2024). With the increasing
complexity of decision-making settings and the ris­
ing demand for cross-disciplinary expertise to tackle
decision-making problems, large-scale group deci­
sion making (LSGDM) has become a focal point of
research (Tang & Liao, 2021). To fully leverage the
role of a large group, scholars have proposed many
models from various perspectives to extract and har­
ness human intelligence, such as expert behaviours
(Gou et al., 2021), subgroup classification (Liang
et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2020), consensus-building
method (Meng et al., 2023) and preference informa­
tion aggregation (Chen et al., 2022). Thus, tradi­
tional LSGDM relies mostly on the experience and
intuition of human experts. However, human
experts may be influenced by subjective biases
(Liang et al., 2024), information overload (Laker
et al., 2018), and limited learning capacity (Boyacı
et al., 2024), resulting in uncertainty and bias in
decision-making outcomes.
Nowadays, with the development in computa­
tional power of information technologies and data

availability, scholars and business organizations are
no longer limited to using human intelligence and
have begun to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) tech­
niques to develop a variety of GDM systems in a
wide range of fields (Garcia et al., 2024). For
example, AI helps clinicians make clinical decisions
in vascular surgery, including patient classification,
early diagnosis, and surgical risk assessment, by ana­
lyzing huge and unstructured data (Lareyre et al.,
2023). Finnish IT company Tieto announced the
appointment of AI to their leadership team (Zheng
et al., 2023). Additionally, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI), as an emerging technology in
the field of AI, is increasingly demonstrating its
ability to make advantageous predictions (Hermann
& Puntoni, 2024). Understanding features and
effective tips of GenAI can help people make wise
decisions regarding their problems (Beilby &
Hammarberg, 2024). For example, in the context of
medical decision making, Sorin et al. (2023)
explored the utilization of ChatGPT as a decision
support tool for breast tumour boards. They pro­
vided ChatGPT-3.5 with clinical information about
10 consecutive patients. They then asked the chatbot
to perform three tasks: summarization, recommen­
dation, and explanation. In 70% of cases, the chat­
bot’s recommendations agreed with the tumour

board’s decisions. However, Saban and Dubovi
(2024) found that GenAI tools exhibited a proclivity
towards indecision and over-triage in comparison to
human clinicians. Ray et al. (2023) argued that
GenAI provides clinicians with powerful tools to
improve surgical precision, diagnostic accuracy, and
treatment planning, but AI was meant to flag rele­
vant studies for human review, rather than replacing
the physician’s assessment.
While scholars acknowledge the potential of
GenAI in GDM, it still has shortcomings compared
to human intelligence such as limited interpretabil­
ity, the possibility of generating false information,
restricted reasoning capabilities, and ethical con­
cerns (Ray et al., 2023; Saban & Dubovi, 2024; Thuy
& Benoit, 2024; Vasey et al., 2022). Human experts
utilize cognitive flexibility to integrate various sour­
ces of information, but they are limited by their
cognitive capacity when it comes to evaluating large
volumes of data. Fortunately, both human and AI
have their own strengths, possessing the potential to
complement each other’s shortcomings. A nascent
agreement is to employ the symbiotic relationship
between human and AI (Wang et al., 2024). For
example, the coordination between human radiolog­
ists and AI improved the overall accuracy of pneu­
monia diagnosis compared to radiologists or AI
alone (Patel et al., 2019). Given the strengths of
both human experts and AI, researchers are increas­
ingly acknowledging the benefits of reciprocal learn­
ing—a form of human-AI learning loop that
leverages the complementary capabilities of each to
achieve consensus (Jussupow et al., 2021; Sturm
et al., 2021). Therefore, it is critical to combine
strengths of AI and human intuition to ensure the
continued viability of decision-making processes
(Choudhary et al., 2025; Te’eni et al., 2023).
To fully harness the strengths of both human
experts and AI in the consensus, it is necessary to
develop a LSGDM model considering heterogeneous
preferences of experts and AI. Consensus buildingapproach based on multiple feedbacks is a way to
achieve a shared situation among different stake­
holders. Consensus-based human-AI decisionmaking model can promote deep integration of
LSGDM processes. However, addressing this prob­
lem entails navigating several critical challenges. The
first challenge is the measurement of GenAI’s par­
ticipation degree in LSGDM. In traditional LSGDM,
the weights of experts are often determined based
on the trustworthiness of experts in the group.
However, in real life, due to factors such as humans’
trust and acceptance on AI, AI’s decision in differ­
ent scenarios may be endowed with varying degrees
of participation. The second is the measurement of
the consensus between experts and GenAI.

Consensus is traditionally measured based on
whether the consensus of a group exceeds a preset
threshold. If GenAI is integrated into the group,
how to measure the reliability of GenAI’s decision
and effectively induce the consensus between GenAI
and experts is an important issue. The third is the
determination of the feedback strategy for the con­
sensus-building approach. In traditional LSGDM,
feedback is generated by selecting experts or sub­
groups of experts who are not reached the consen­
sus threshold and providing suggestions for them to
revise their preferences. However, in feedback strat­
egies involving GenAI, experts may not have suffi­
cient willingness to cooperate with GenAI.
To address these above challenges, we propose an
LSGDM model to combine GenAI and experts’ pref­
erences, and develop a consensus-building approach.
We investigate the unity of subgroup consensus and
subgroup-AI consensus. The impact of GenAI on
the consensus-building process will be explored.
The main contributions of our research are three­
fold: (1) The impact of GenAI’s different levels of
participation on the consensus process is studied.
Feedback strategies are conducted based on three
different scenarios (GenAI as the decisive role,
GenAI as the equal role, and GenAI as the auxiliary
role). (2) A threshold measure based on subgroup
consensus and subgroup-AI consensus is proposed.
We introduce a new weight measurement method
to determine the standard weight with different
decision-making bodies, and determine the consen­
sus threshold based on subgroup consensus and
subgroup-AI consensus. (3) A minimum cost con­
sensus (MCC) model based on heterogeneous feed­
back strategies is constructed. Feedback adjustment
parameters of experts are set based on experts’ atti­
tudes towards GenAI. Finally, the applicability of
our proposed model is verified based on a medical
diagnosis case.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol­
lows. Section 2 is a literature review, including
human-AI decision making, LSGDM and MCC
models. Section 3 proposes the main model with
heterogeneous feedback strategies in three scenarios.
Section 4 illustrates application of our proposed
model using a case study about medical diagnosis.
Section 5 presents comparative analysis. Section 6
concludes the paper with implications, limitations
and future work.

2. Literature review
In this section, we review two streams of relevant
literature: (1) Human-AI decision making, (2)
LSGDM and MCC models.

related literature on human-AI decision making. We
found that AI has been assigned different roles in
human-AI teams.

AI, which refers to “the ability of a system to identify,
interpret, make inferences, and learn from data to
achieve predetermined organizational and societal
goals” (Mikalef & Gupta, 2021) has been incorporated
into algorithms to make them more powerful
(Mahmud et al., 2022). However, there are still ethical
issues associated with the use of AI, such as data priv­
acy and the potential for AI bias to influence the out­
come of decisions. Therefore, people have different
attitudes toward the use of AI, and these attitudes also
directly affect the final perception of experts’ decisions
(Mahmud et al., 2024). People embracing AI believe
that human-AI coordination can accelerate decisionmaking efficiency (Mahmud et al., 2024). People with
AI aversion may worry about negative impacts of AI
(Burton et al., 2020).
Certainty, the most promising application of AI
is not to replace humans, but rather synergize with
them, creating “superminds” capable of accomplish­
ing cognitive and physical tasks that were once con­
sidered impossible (Malone et al., 2020). An
increasing number of studies have found that when
humans and AI make decisions together, the overall
quality of decisions is improved (Patel et al., 2019).
However, the effect of AI’s decision varies across
domains. For example, Selby et al. (2024) found that
Large Language Model based inference has good
downstream performance in medicine, business, and
biology, but not in other domains. Table 1 reviews

2.2. LSGDM and MCC models
LSGDM is a process in which a large number of
experts evaluate a set of feasible alternatives and select
the best solution. Since there are many stakeholders
with different backgrounds in LSGDM, consensus
reaching-process (CRP) is particularly important in
LSGDM. CRP is an iterative and dynamic process. In
this process, experts discuss and modify their initial
preferences to reach a collective preference that is sat­
isfactory to all experts. Such a process is usually
guided and supervised by a person called the super­
visor (Tang et al., 2020). The typical consensus model
of LSGDM includes four aspects: preference aggrega­
tion, degree of consensus measurement, feedback
mechanism design and alternative selection.
To build a CRP at the smallest possible cost,
Ben-Arieh and Easton (2007) first introduced the
concept of MCC model. Later, many scholars made
improvements on this model. Table 2 presents a
summary of some MCC models in LSGDM.
Existing models set experts’ adjustment cost accord­
ing to preference gap, or use the same adjustment
cost. However, this situation ignores acceptance of
preference adjustment by experts. Therefore, to
make up for the existing limitations, we consider
experts’ attitudes toward GenAI when adjusting

3.1. Model setup
The CRP process of our model is shown in Figure 1.
We develop a CRP to achieve an outcome between
experts and GenAI. First, the model uses an improved
Density Peaks Clustering (DPC) algorithm to classify

large-scale experts into subgroups. Then, weights of
experts, subgroups and GenAI are introduced. On this
basis, considering three levels of participation of GenAI,
the degrees of consensus at different levels are calcu­
lated, and a MCC model with heterogeneous feedback
strategies is proposed. Finally, the model is applied to a
medical diagnosis example to verify its feasibility.

Based on Eq. (1), the distance between two
experts can be obtained; based on Eq. (2), experts’
similarity matrices can be obtained.
To assess the cohesion of subgroups, we combine
experts’ preference similarity, social trust and atti­
tudes towards GenAI to obtain the Similarity-TrustAttitude (STA) score. We assume that preference
similarity, trust relationship and attitude are equally
important in clustering process, and we draw
Einstein’s T-paradigm idea to calculate the STA
score.
Let STAkh be the STA score from expert ek to eh ;

STAkh ; the higher the probability that ek and ek are

The DPC algorithm has been widely used in vari­
ous data clustering tasks (Li et al., 2018; 2024).
Unlike algorithms such as k-means, which require a
pre-specified number of clusters, the DPC algorithm
can recognize data of any shape, visually identify
the number of clusters in the data and effectively
identify outliers (Meng et al., 2023). However, the
stability of the clustering centre selection in the
DPC algorithm is relatively low, in this study, we
proposed an improved DPC algorithm to enhance
the stability of clustering centres and applied it to
classify experts. Algorithm 1 presents the steps of
the improved DPC algorithm.

3.3. Weight determination and consensus
measure
3.3.1. Weight determination
After clustering, the weights of experts in subgroups
and weights of subgroups should be determined.
Step 1. Determine the weights of experts in a
subgroup.
The weight of an expert in a group is calculated
based on the combination of direct trust, indirect
trust, and expert centrality:
wkl ¼ x1 � DTk þ x2 � ITk þ x3 � CTk

(4)

where wkl denotes the weight of ek in Cl ; DTk
denotes the direct trust of ek ; ITk denotes the

indirect trust of ek ; and CTk denotes the degree cen­
trality of ek : x1 ; x2 and x3 corresponds to initial
weight of three items in Eq. (4), respectively.
x1 þ x2 þ x3 ¼ 1; x1 ; x2 ; x3 >0.
Step 2. Calculate the weights of subgroups and
GenAI.
In general, the greater the self-confidence of sub­
group members, the less they are affected by social
influence, and the more likely they adhere to their
initial preferences (Tu et al., 2024). According to the
characteristic of IFN, a smaller intuitionistic fuzzy
entropy means a greater evaluation confidence.
Therefore, we calculate the weights of subgroups
and GenAI by the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy.
According to Chen et al. (2022), for an IFS A ¼
�
x, lA ðxi Þ, � A ðxi Þjxi 2 X g; the intuitionistic fuzzy
entropy of A is defined as:
�

EðAÞ ¼

(5)
where DA ðxi Þ ¼ jðlA ðxi Þ − � A ðxi ÞÞ=ðlA ðxi Þþ � A ðxi ÞÞj
represents the power of IFS A:
Based on the above definition of intuitionistic
fuzzy entropy, the subgroup average decisionmaking matrix Pl ¼ ðplij Þm�n and the GenAI deci­
sion-making matrix PAI ¼ ðpAI
ij Þm�n are constructed.
If only the proportion of weights among subgroups
is considered, the weight of a subgroup can be

In this section, we calculate the degree of consensus
at expert level, subgroup level, subgroup-AI level
and global level, respectively.

ence need to be adjusted to achieve the threshold.

3.4.1. Feedback scenarios
If the group consensus threshold is not reached, it is
necessary to provide feedback to adjust experts’ prefer­
ences or GenAI’s preference and then recalculate the
degree of consensus until the threshold is reached.
Therefore, we propose a MCC model based on experts’
attitudes towards GenAI and give different feedback
strategies according to human-AI interaction scenarios.
To better reflect the interaction between GenAI’s deci­
sion and human experts’ decisions, GenAI also takes
part in each round of consensus iteration.

Global level: the global consensus for the whole
group
The degree of global consensus GACD is a meas­
ure of the final degree of consensus among experts
and GenAI. We use the minimum value of ACDl
and AACDl−AI to represent GACD; which allows us
to control the threshold for both subgroup consen­
sus and subgroup-AI consensus. Then, the global
consensus level GACD can be obtained as:

where pAI
ij denotes the preference of GenAI that
needs feedback adjustment, and pave
denotes the
ij
average decision of all subgroups. #2½0,1� is an
adjustment parameter, which indicates the degree of
retention of GenAI to its own preference.
The following focuses on analyzing the feedback
performance of experts in different scenarios.

It is easy to prove 0�GACD�1. A larger value of
GACD indicates a higher degree of consensus.

3.4.1.1. Scenario I: GenAI as the decisive role. The
importance of GenAI’s decision in the decisionmaking process lies in its ability to handle largescale data analysis or realize rapid response, etc.
For example, in areas such as climate prediction and
high-frequency trading, GenAI not only improves

the speed and accuracy of decisions, but also enable
effective decisions in areas that are difficult for
humans to access. GenAI’s decision is often decisive
in these specific scenarios.
When the feedback process is activated, the sub­
group that contributes the least to the global con­
sensus is first identified for modification, which is
marked as Cadj : The preference of GenAI is treated
as a reference for preference modification, that is,
subgroups who are not within the threshold will
modify their preferences toward GenAI’s prefer­
ence. The adjustment direction of subgroups’ deci­
sions in Scenario I is depicted in Figure 2. The
blue points in a black circle represent a subgroup
and the red point represents the centre of sub­
group. The green circle represents the adjustment
centre range.

3.4.1.2. Scenario II: GenAI as the equal role. In
many decision-making environments, GenAI and
experts act side-by-side and together form the core
of the decision-making process. For example, in
medical diagnosis, GenAI can quickly analyze com­
plex data and provide initial judgments, while doc­
tors make diagnostic decisions by integrating
the patient’s situation and their own experience.
These scenarios emphasize the complementary char­
acteristics of GenAI’s decision and experts’ deci­
sions, which makes the final decision more
comprehensive.
In this scenario, the average preference of GenAI
and experts is treated as a reference for preference
modification, that is, subgroups who are not within
the threshold will modify their preferences toward
GenAI-experts’ average preference. The adjustment
direction of subgroups’ decisions in Scenario II is
depicted in Figure 3.

where qk 2 ½0,1� is an adjustment parameter that

Empirical studies have shown that if there is a
GenAI’s decision, when regular experts adjust deci­
sion outcomes, the influence of authoritative experts
diminishes (Zheng et al., 2023). Therefore, if GenAI
plays the decisive role, we assume that experts
within subgroups have equal weight.

Scenario III.

Experts refer to GenAI’s decision when the con­
sensus is difficult to reach. It has been shown that
dissenting participants tend to reflect on their own
decisions when it is noted that GenAI’s decision
and other experts’ decisions have consistent results
(Zheng et al., 2023). Therefore, in this scenario, we
calculate the weight of a subgroup according to the
degree of consensus between subgroup’s decision
and GenAI’s decision, and only subgroup consensus
is considered.

of experts within the same subgroup is reduced, and
the expert weights are changed.
The weight of expert ek is calculated as follows:

3.4.2. Feedback model setup
Based on the above analysis, the MCC model is
established as follows:

x01 � log ð1 þ DTk Þ þ x02 � log ð1 þ ITk Þ þ x03 � log ð1 þ CTk Þ

h2cl x1 � log ð1 þ DTh Þ þ x2 � log ð1 þ ITh Þ þ x3 � log ð1 þ CTh Þ

(15)
x01 ; x02 and x03 corresponds to the adjusted weights of
the direct trust value, the indirect trust value, and the
centrality value. x01 þ x02 þ x03 ¼ 1; x01 ; x02 ; x03 >0.
The log function is used to moderate the magnitude
of inconsistency among the direct trust value, the
indirect trust value, and the centrality value. In add­
ition, the weight of ek is normalized to ensure that
the sum of weights in each subgroup is 1.
3.4.1.3. Scenario III: GenAI as the auxiliary role. In
some decision-making scenarios, GenAI plays the
auxiliary role and the final decision remains in
hands of human experts. This relationship is par­
ticularly notable in domains where experts’ experi­
ence and intuition are irreplaceable but can benefit
from data analysis, such as artistic creation,
advanced research and development, and so on (Bell
et al., 2024). This process demonstrates the irrepla­
ceability of human experts in complex decisions.
In this scenario, the average preference of experts
is treated as a reference for preference modification,
that is, subgroups who are not within the threshold
will modify their preferences toward the average
preference of all subgroups. The adjustment direc­
tion of subgroups’ decisions in Scenario III is
depicted in Figure 4.
Considering experts’ tendency to insist on their
own preferences, the final modification suggestion

ments. ck is inversely proportional to the expert’s
attitude towards GenAI. In this study, ck ¼ 1=sak :
3.4.3. Selection process
If the degree of global consensus GACD reaches the
threshold r; the model will go into the selection process.
First, the decision score Gi of xi is obtained based
on the final global preference matrix:

where pGij is the preference value of xi regarding cj in
the final global preference matrix PG : In Scenario I and
Scenario II, PG is the average matrix of all subgroups’
preferences and GenAI’s matrix. In scenario III, PG is
the average matrix of all subgroups’ preferences.
Then, according to scoring function of IFN, the
final score of xi is obtained as:
SðGi Þ ¼ lGi − � Gi

Finally, all alternatives are ranked according to
their scores, and the highest scoring alternative is
selected as the best alternative.

3.5. Summarization of the proposed model
The flowchart of our proposed LSGDM model is
shown in Figure 5.
Steps of our proposed LSGDM model are as
follows.
Step 1: Collect information related to decision mak­
ing from experts and GenAI.
Step 2: Classify experts into several clusters via our
improved DPC algorithm.
Step 3: Determine weights of experts and GenAI by
Eqs. (4)–(7).
Step 4: Calculate the degree of consensus: CDkl ,
ACDl , AACDl−AI and GACD:

Figure 5. Flowchart of our proposed LSGDM model.

Step 5: If GACD � r; then go to selection process;
otherwise, select subgroups that need to make
modifications and go to next step.
Step 6: Generate heterogeneous feedback adjustment
strategies to help experts modify their preferences.
Step 7: Rank alternatives based on global preferences.

4. Case study
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is
one of the most prevalent chronic lung diseases and
is currently the fourth leading cause of death. Even
experienced medical professionals are difficult to give
a definite clinical diagnosis. Fortunately, big data has
been used as a valuable source of COPD detection
(Rhee, 2021). Previous studies have applied AI to
detect COPD features (Wang et al., 2020).
There is an electronic medical record of a COPD
patient. The electronic medical record includes basic
information about patient and diagnose. To minimize

JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY

the decision risk, 20 experts ek ðk ¼ 1, 2, :::, 20Þ from
fields of pulmonology, surgery, pharmacology and
psychology, respectively, are invited to determine the
best alternative for patient’s treatment. After careful
consultation, four treatment alternatives X ¼
fx1 , x2 , x3 , x4 g are identified. x1 is standard drug ther­
apy including the use of bronchodilators and cortico­
steroids; x2 is comprehensive rehabilitation including
physiotherapy, nutritional guidance, and psychosocial
support; x3 is a minimally invasive procedure such as
lung volume reduction; x4 is the experimental drug
therapy, including the latest development of targeted
drugs for COPD. By analyzing these four alternatives,
treatment alternatives are given four criteria to be
evaluated C ¼ fc1 , c2 , c3 , c4 g: c1 is the therapeutic effi­
cacy, which includes symptomatic relief and improve­
ment in lung function; c2 is the side effect, which
includes possible adverse reactions that may occur
during course of treatment; c3 is the cost, which takes
into account economic cost of treatment alternative;
c4 is the patient acceptance, which includes patient’s
preference and compliance with treatment regimen.
The weight vector of four criteria is Z ¼
ð0:4, 0:3, 0:2, 0:1Þ: GenAI evaluates four treatment
alternatives by analyzing a large amount of historical
treatment data of COPD patients and then gives a
preference score.
To obtain the attitudes of experts toward GenAI,
we design a pre-experiment of human-AI coordin­
ation, which is shown in Figure 6. A dynamic web
application is built to provide core functions for
patient diagnostic systems, such as valuation of
patient treatment plan outcomes, reasons for plan
selection, and reliability of results, based on which
an expert can select models and other functions of
AI with which he/she can interact.
After appropriate exercises and interactions (it is
stipulated that each expert should familiarize himself/
herself with the AI system for no less than 30 min and
interact with it no less than five times), experts pro­
vide their attitudes towards AI by combining the
assessment of the accuracy of the AI, the interpret­
ability, and the transparency of the system, and do
not change it. Figure 7 displays the overall flowchart.
Figure 8 depicts trust relationships between
experts (black lines) and experts’ attitude towards
GenAI (red numbers). Based on relevant literature
and task scenarios studied in this article, parameters
are set as follows: dc ¼2, a¼0.6, gh ¼0.5, h1 ¼5,
r¼0.9, #¼0.3, x1 ¼0.3, x2 ¼0.1, x3 ¼0.6, x01 ¼0.6,
x02 ¼0.2, x03 ¼0.2.
To find the best alternative, the following steps
are carried out.
Step 1. Information collection.
The raw preference matrices of experts and the
preference of GenAI are shown in Table 4.

11

Step 2. Clustering
Using the DPC algorithm, twenty experts are
classified into three subgroups. Preferences of sub­
groups are shown in Table 5.
Step 3. Weight determination
The weights of subgroups are obtained based on
Eqs. (4)–(7), as shown in Table 6.
Step 4. Consensus measure
Initial consensus is obtained based on Eqs. (8)–
(11), as shown in Table 7.
Step 5. As can be seen from Table 7, GACD <
0:9: Thus, the feedback process should be
implemented.
Step 6. Activate heterogeneous feedback
strategies
(1) Scenario I
According to feedback strategy of Scenario I,
experts’ preferences are adjusted based on the MCC
model. The weights of experts in C1 are [1/6,1/6,1/
6,1/6,1/6,1/6]T; the weights of experts in C2 are
[0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]T; the weights of experts in C3
are [0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1]T.
Adjusted consensus is obtained in Table 8.
(2) Scenario II
According to feedback strategy of Scenario II,
experts’ preferences are adjusted based on the MCC
model. The weights of experts in C1 are [0.1572,
0.1664,0.211,0.1656,0.1468,0.153]T; the weights of
experts in C2 are [0.2526,0.2449,0.2519,0.2506]T; the
weights of experts in C3 are [0.0989,0.0919,
0.0993,0.0849,0.1093,0.077,0.1006,0.1072,0.1256,0.10­
53]T.
Adjusted consensus is obtained in Table 9.
(3) Scenario III
According to feedback strategy of Scenario III,
experts’ preferences are adjusted based on the MCC
model. The weights of experts in C1 are
[0.1647,0.1563,0.1506,0.1692,0.1815,
0.1777]T;
weights

942]T.
Adjusted consensus is shown in Table 10.
Step 7. Selection process
The final evaluation information for Scenario I is:
G1 :< 0:6311, 0:2162 > ,
G2 :< 0:5800, 0:2019 > ,
G3 :< 0:6598, 0:1833 > ,
G4 :< 0:5780, 0:1885 > :
Based on the scoring function of IFN, the follow­
ing results are obtained: SðG1 Þ ¼ 0.4149, SðG2 Þ ¼
0.3781, SðG3 Þ ¼ 0.4765, SðG4 Þ ¼ 0.3895.
Therefore, we can obtain the final ranking:
x3 >x1 > x4 >x2 : The best alternative is x3 :

5. Simulations and comparisons
5.1. The impact of GenAI’s role
To illustrate the impact of GenAI’s role, this section
only considers experts without GenAI’s involvement
in the proposed model. Other settings remain
unchanged. The degree of consensus is shown in
Table 11.
The final evaluation information is:
G1 :< 0:5692, 0:2875 > ,
G2 :< 0:5077, 0:2470 > ,
G3 :< 0:5926, 0:201 > ,
G4 :< 0:5443, 0:2076 >
We
have
SðG1 Þ¼0.2817,
SðG2 Þ¼0.2607,
SðG3 Þ¼0.3916, SðG4 Þ¼0.3367. Therefore, x3 > x4
> x1 > x2 : The best alternative is x3 :
The decision-making results in four different sce­
narios are given in Table 12.
In terms of the adjustment cost, Scenario I and
Scenario II have a higher cost than other scenarios.
Moreover, Scenario III and No-GenAI has the
smallest subgroup iterations. This is due to the
emergence of GenAI’s decision as a new reference
expert, which has increased discussions among
expert groups. Regarding the ranking of alternatives,
it can be seen that the order of (x1 ; x4 ) changes
with the level of participation of GenAI. As the par­
ticipation level of GenAI increases, the gap between
x1 and x4 decreases (x1 is gradually close to x4 ).
Therefore, it can be concluded that GenAI has a
certain impact on the decision-making result, which
can be used as a reference for experts.
5.2. Impact of different consensus thresholds

ferences in experts’ backgrounds, knowledge, and

professional skills, it is necessary to set the thresh­
old reasonably based on the specificity of task deci­
sion-making. In current research, the values for
predefined thresholds are usually set to 0.9 (Gong
et al., 2024), 0.85 (Gou et al., 2021), and 0.8 (Tang
et al., 2020). For some crucial and significant
issues, the minimum consensus level should be
very high. However, in other extreme cases, such
as emergency problems, the degree of consensus
reached due to time constraints should be lower
(Xu et al., 2015). Since medical decision-making is
a high-risk decision, in this study, we set the con­
sensus threshold to 0.9, which is a relatively high
value.
This section explores the impact of consensus
thresholds. Eight consensus thresholds f0:85,
0:86, :::, 0:92g are assigned to r to explore the per­
formance of the proposed model. Table 13 provides
the performance of the proposed model in terms of
three key metrics: number of iterations, adjustment
cost and the degree of final global consensus. In
addition, to better reflect the efficiency of the CRP,
the number of GenAI iterations is also provided.
For example, “1 þ 2” indicates one iteration of sub­
groups and two iterations of GenAI.
As can be seen from Table 13, the number of
iterations gradually increases as the consensus
threshold grows. This means that the higher the
requirement for global consensus, the more modifi­
cations need to be made. However, it is not difficult
to find that no matter the level of the consensus
threshold, the model can effectively improve global
consensus within a limited number of iterations.
Even if r¼0.92, only (4 þ 4) iterations are needed to
fulfil consensus requirement. These results show
that our proposed model can effectively help experts
reach consensus and thus solve the LSGDM
problem.

5.3. Impact of the unit adjustment cost

6. Discussions and conclusions

Scholars have discussed the impact of the unit
adjustment cost on decision results. For instance,
Wu et al. (2022) found that the adjustment cost
affects initial clustering result and the group consen­
sus’s achievement level. However, the current
research based on the unit adjustment cost is mostly
obtained based on subjective settings. This study
relies on experts’ attitude towards GenAI when
determining the unit adjustment cost, which makes
it more in line with real-world human-AI interactive
setting. Taking C2 as an example, Table 14 describes
the impact of different unit adjustment costs under
Scenario II.
Experts’ attitude towards GenAI in C2 is f0.6,
0.7, 0.6, 0.95g. The first column of Table 14 pro­
vides different cost functions associated with SA: It
can be seen that adjustment costs under different
functions yield different adjustment results.
Compared to the unified cost method, the methods
based on four functions all substantially increase the
amount of adjustment for e12 (the third expert in
the bracket, whose decision attitude towards GenAI
is relatively optimistic), and moderately decrease the
amount of adjustment for e9 ; e10 and e11 : This result
is consistent with the fact that experts with AI aver­
sion have a weaker willingness to modify in the
feedback process. The total adjustment costs for the
first iteration are 3.51, 3.49, 3.51, 3.52, and 3.68,
respectively, under each method for the unit cost of
f1:67, 1:43, 1:67, 1:05g: It can be seen that the
method for different unit adjustment costs reduces
the total costs, which verifies the validity of using
the heterogeneous adjustment feedback strategies.

We proposed a new LSGDM model including the
participation of GenAI, and analyzed CRP of
LSGDM when GenAI has different degrees of par­
ticipation in decision making. First, the model used
an improved DPC algorithm to classify experts.
Second, initial weights of experts were determined
based on the internal influence of experts, and the
weights of subgroups and GenAI are calculated
based on intuitionistic fuzzy entropy. In addition,
the consensus at different levels is calculated, and a
MCC model for heterogeneous feedback strategies
in different scenarios is proposed. To validate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the model, a medical
diagnosis example with comparative analysis is per­
formed. We found that GenAI has different impacts
under different levels of GenAI’s participation, and
heterogeneous adjustment strategies can effectively
reduce the adjustment cost.
Our proposed model is highly adaptable. While we
use a medical case study for validation, the model is
equally applicable to other domains. For instance, in
judicial decision making, AI can be trained to provide
legal recommendations by analyzing relevant laws
and judicial precedents. AI model can take into
account factors such as similar precedent cases, case
characteristics, and legal provisions, and AI’s deci­
sions can then be compared with the rulings of
relevant judges to gather consensus feedback.
Additionally, the model can be applied to emergency
response plan selection, paper ranking in scientific
research competitions, and the evaluation of innova­
tions in enterprise technologies. Depending on the
complexity of the decision-making task, different
human-AI coordination strategies can be employed.

5.4. Comparisons with existing LSGDM models
To verify the superiority of the proposed model, a
comparative analysis with existing LSGDM models
is carried out. The results are shown in Table 15.
The LSGDM model in this study takes the AI per­
spective into account, making it a unique feature.
We first explore how to incorporate different types
of interactions between human experts and AI in
the CRP and propose corresponding feedback strat­
egies. Therefore, the model proposed in this study is
in line with the mainstream trend of AI’s decision
being increasingly important. Furthermore, our
model sets heterogeneous unit adjustment costs for
different experts according to experts’ attitude
towards AI, which also improves upon the previous
literature of subjectively setting unit adjustment
costs. Our model also has a comprehensive perspec­
tive when clustering experts. Most of the studies did
not consider the effect of experts’ social relations,
such as the social status and the degree of trust.

6.1. Management implications
This study has theoretical and managerial implica­
tions. First, the LSGDM model in this paper demon­
strates the potential of human-AI coordination.
With the rapid development of advanced technique,
enterprises and policy makers increasingly rely on
data and AI to make decisions (Xu et al., 2024). The
participation of GenAI can make up for insufficient
cognitive capacity or information overload brought
by the decision making of a single party (experts)
and improve the ability to solve complex decisionmaking problems involving various elements. In
addition, when dealing with decisions involving
multiple stakeholders, adding GenAI’s decision can
improve fairness and diversity of decisions. Second,
the feedback strategy plays a significant role in coor­
dinating GenAI decision making with expert deci­
sion making. Until now, human-AI coordination
has been performed in various fields (De V�ericourt

the decision feedback brought by interpretability
and interactivity characteristics of GenAI has not
been considered. This study inspires scholars to
explore human-AI decision-making outcomes from
an interactive feedback perspective. The results indi­
cate that the proposed human-AI coordination
model based on heterogeneous feedback strategies
can effectively reduce adjustment costs. Meanwhile,

for managers, this means that they can optimize
decision-making process by adjusting decision feed­
back strategy, thereby more effectively utilizing
resources and time.
The limitation of ethical issues regarding AI has
always been a central focus of scholarly research,
particularly in high-stake fields such as healthcare
and criminal justice (Barrera Ferro et al., 2025).
While ethical dilemmas do exist in the use of AI, it

is likely that AI will either complement, coexist
with, or even replace current systems, ushering in a
new era of AI in healthcare or other fields. In fact,
it may be considered unscientific not to use AI
(Naik et al., 2022). In response to the current short­
comings in human-AI coordination, the following
measures can be taken to effectively reduce the limi­
tation of AI: 1) using diverse and representative
data; 2) developing various privacy protection tech­
niques (federal learning, blockchain, etc.); 3)
improving the interpretability and transparency of
AI systems; 4) improving collaborative communica­
tion and education in the use of AI among AI
designers and developers, policymakers, and experts.

Therefore, prior to implementing the human-AI
coordination model proposed in this study, humancentred design principles should be integrated into
the AI development process to ensure systematic
review and regulatory oversight. Additionally, train­
ing and education on AI usage, along with preexperimental operations, should be conducted to
reasonably assess AI’s role in decision-making
(Schwalbe & Wahl, 2020).
6.2. Limitations and future work
This study still has limitations. First, this study does
not address extreme cases where there is a conflict

JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY

between experts’ decisions and GenAI’s decision,
leaving room for future research into the behav­
ioural dynamics and feedback processes of humanAI decision making within the CRP. Second, the
current study assumes that experts’ attitudes towards
GenAI remain static, potential changes in experts’
behaviour influenced by reliance on AI over time
can be considered in the future. Third, the current
data is small, and future efforts will be made to
obtain large hospital-specific data through conduct­
ing specific interviews with doctors regarding their
willingness to engage with AI in decision making.
Fourth, ethical concerns raised by AI have not yet
been explored in depth, such as data privacy and
the potential for AI bias to influence decision out­
comes. Future research will further examine how
these factors influence the CRP in LSGDM’s
human-AI coordination.
