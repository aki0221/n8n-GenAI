ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

In the current era of global integration, and the fourth industrial revolution requires
the education system to transform and combine traditional education with online
education. Therefore, educational innovations are being implemented globally to
meet the increasing demands of the modern labor market. However, Vietnamese education faces many challenges in innovation, such as the curriculum being too theoretical and lacking practicality. These teaching methods do not encourage creative and
critical thinking, and unequal access to education exists between regions. Dewey’s
philosophy emphasizes experiential education, where students learn through practical
experiences, critical thinking, and problem-solving instead of passively absorbing
knowledge. These ideas are consistent with current educational reforms in Vietnam,
especially in transitioning from traditional education to an active learning model,
developing creative thinking, and strengthening the connection between education
and real life, technology, AI, and Big Data, and careers. Their combination is intertwined, creating a powerful synergy in innovation and success for Vietnam education
today.

Introduction
In the context of globalization and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, international education requires a
flexible, creative, and practical learning system to train highly qualified human resources to meet the
needs of the knowledge economy. Vietnam is no exception to this trend as the labor market requires
workers to have in-depth knowledge of science and technology and, at the same time, must be proficient in labor skills such as critical thinking, creativity, cooperation, and adaptation to change (Earl,
2025). However, Vietnam’s human resources have not yet met these requirements due to many limitations, such as educational methods that are still heavily theoretical, lacking practicality and application,
and labor skills that are not linked to the needs of businesses and the labor market. Additionally, there
is inequality in access to education between regions in the country, including mountainous and plains
areas, urban and rural areas, and central and peripheral regions (Shinjo et al., 2024). The cause of this
situation comes from the education system that has not kept up with the innovation trend; traditional
teaching methods have not created conditions for learners to develop creative thinking, critical thinking,
and practical professional skills (O’Leary et al., 2023). Therefore, Vietnamese education today needs to be
reformed in the direction of experimentation, encouraging innovation to develop the scientific research,
technology, and creative capacity of learners while ensuring fairness in education so that all citizens,
regardless of region, have equal learning opportunities (Le et al., 2023; Tran & Do, 2024). A modern education system needs to create proactive and positive people in learning and working, contributing to
the prosperous development of the country. Meanwhile, John Dewey (1859-1952) was a famous
American philosopher and educator who contributed significantly to modern educational theory. He promoted experiential education, emphasizing that students learn best through direct interaction with realCONTACT Kien Pham Thi

life situations and environments. He also promoted democratic education and civic responsibility, considering schools as places to practice cooperative thinking and participate in shared decision-making. In addition, Dewey encouraged education for innovative thinking, developing creativity, and problem-solving
skills to prepare students to face the challenges of modern society. Dewey’s educational philosophy
emphasizes three core elements: experimental education, democracy in education, and the proactive role
of learners (Dewey, 1938). These ideas are essential for Vietnamese education, as they aim to train citizens
to adapt, be creative, and think critically. This study hypothesizes that applying Dewey’s educational philosophy can help Vietnam reform its education more modernly, overcome current limitations, and meet
future labor market requirements. This study uses analytical and synthetic methods to clarify issues related
to Vietnamese education in the current context. The analytical method is applied to examine and evaluate
each factor, such as the current state of human resources, limitations in the educational system, and the
requirements for innovation. Meanwhile, the synthetic method helps to connect the analytical results and
systematize the positive and negative factors of Vietnamese education and the values that Dewey’s educational philosophy builds. This shows the suitability of the Vietnamese education system when applying
Dewey’s educational philosophy to the cause of educational innovation in Vietnam and proposes suitable
solutions for the cause of educational innovation in Vietnam. Combining these two methods ensures logic
and science and helps the research have a solid theoretical basis, proposing effective educational innovation. This research has practical significance in clearly defining the directions for educational innovation in
Vietnam, from changing teaching methods and training programs to improving the quality of comprehensive education, aiming to build an advanced education system suitable for developing the knowledge
economy and global integration.

Research objectives
This study examines the application of Dewey’s educational philosophy in Vietnam, focusing on experiential learning, democratic education, and innovation. It aims to analyze the challenges and opportunities
within Vietnam’s education system, assess the feasibility of Dewey reforms, and propose evidence-based

Literature review
John Dewey’s educational philosophy is foundational in pragmatic education. His emphasis on experiential learning and integrating education with real-life experiences sets his approach apart from that of his

COGENT EDUCATION

contemporaries and modern educational theorists. This comprehensive review will compare Dewey’s
philosophy with other key figures in pragmatism and global educational theory, highlighting both convergences and divergences. Additionally, it will identify the superiority of Dewey’s educational philosophy and point out gaps in current research that this article aims to address.

First, education as experience: learning through engagement
In ‘Democracy and Education’ (Dewey, 2024), he argues that learning should not be limited to rote
memorization but should engage students in activities that reflect real-life situations, fostering critical
thinking and problem-solving skills. Dewey’s idea that education should be rooted in experience aligns
with the broader pragmatic tradition. Dewey believes that education through experience helps learners
understand and gain expertise, thereby achieving a deep understanding and applying knowledge to
real-life situations. This allows students to become more flexible and creative in the learning process.
William James, a contemporary key figure in pragmatism, also emphasized the importance of experience in learning. However, James focused more on the individual’s experience and personal growth
than Dewey (James, 2001). While Dewey acknowledged the importance of the individual, he placed a
greater emphasis on the social context of education, arguing that learning is inherently a social process.
According to Dewey, education should prepare students to be active and engaged members of their
communities, not just to understand themselves better.
In contrast, Maria Montessori’s educational philosophy also prioritizes experiential learning with a different approach. Montessori emphasized self-directed learning within a prepared environment. Her
method involves providing children with materials stimulating exploration and discovery (Swargiary,
2024). While both Dewey and Montessori value experience as central to learning, Dewey emphasizes
social interactions and democratic participation within the educational environment.
Similarly, Jean Piaget’s constructivist theory emphasizes the role of experience in learning, mainly
through active discovery and interaction with the environment. However, Piaget focuses primarily on
the cognitive stages of development and how children construct knowledge at different stages. On the
other hand, Dewey integrates these cognitive processes within a broader social context, advocating for
an educational system that prepares students for democratic participation and community engagement
(Ottavi, 2024).
William James’s and Dewey’s philosophies belong to the American school of realism, emphasizing the
role of experience and action in constructing knowledge (Dewey, 1938; James, 2006). Both value the
flexibility and practicality of thinking and emphasize the interaction between humans and the environment (Dewey, 1938; James, 2001). However, Dewey surpasses James by applying philosophy to education and social systems, promoting democracy and social reform through experimental methods and
critical thinking (Dewey, 1938).
Empirical studies like Jamison’s have supported Dewey’s emphasis on experiential learning. (Jamison,
2022) found that students involved in real-world projects and internships demonstrate higher engagement levels and better academic performance, similar to Slattery. (2024) proved that hands-on projects
and problem-based learning significantly enhance students’ comprehension and retention of complex
concepts. These findings underscore the practical effectiveness of Dewey’s experiential learning philosophy in contemporary education. Research by Tembrevilla et al. (2024) considers experiential learning in
technical education as an interactive system between individuals, schools, and communities, especially
in the context of the evolving work environment post-COVID-19. This highlights the importance of such
engagement in enhancing the effectiveness and significance of this educational approach. A limitation
of this method is its high demand for resources and thorough preparation from educators, which may
pose challenges for widespread implementation (Chavez-Miyauchi et al., 2021).
Lebert and Vilarroya (2024) explored the relationship between experiential learning (EL) and 4E cognition, arguing that despite their different theoretical foundations, both emphasize the role of concrete
experience in cognition. They suggest that integrating them through the ‘concrete experience’ concept
could create a more comprehensive approach to learning and cognition. Meanwhile, the study by
Coleman et al. (2024) analyzes experiential learning theory in agricultural education, synthesizing recent
empirical research. Their work refines the experiential learning model to emphasize the nonlinearity of

4

K. PHAM THI

this process while proposing a comprehensive framework that incorporates both the process and context of experiential learning (Alford et al., 2024).
Thus, recent studies have affirmed the effectiveness of experiential learning across various educational
fields, from technical education to agriculture, while expanding its connection with 4E cognition theory.
These studies highlight key advantages such as fostering engagement between individuals, schools, and
communities, enhancing critical thinking, improving learning outcomes, and creating a more holistic
educational model. However, these studies still present several limitations, including a lack of a solid theoretical foundation, constrained resources due to the extensive preparation required from educators,
and the need for better integration between traditional and modern educational theories. Future
research should aim to build a more comprehensive theoretical framework, develop more flexible pedagogical models to reduce resource demands, and further integrate cognitive elements to enhance the
applicability and sustainability of this approach in education.

Second, education needs democracy and social responsibility for students
Dewey’s concept of democratic education is another cornerstone of his philosophy. He viewed education
as a democratic process that requires active participation and cooperation from students. In ‘Democracy
and Education’ (Dewey, 2024), he emphasized that education should cultivate a sense of inclusion and
personal responsibility, foster social skills, and prepare students to become active and engaged members
of society.
Paolo Freire, a prominent figure in critical pedagogy, also emphasized democratic education but
focused on empowering students to challenge oppressive structures (Freire, 2020). Freire’s approach is
more politically charged, aiming to transform society through education. While Dewey also saw education as a means of social improvement, his approach focuses on fostering democratic values and social
responsibility within the educational setting.
Emile Durkheim also viewed education as a means of social cohesion and instilling societal norms
and values (Durkheim, 1956). While Durkheim focused more on the structured transmission of societal
norms, Dewey’s approach is more dynamic, involving active participation and community involvement.
Dewey argued that schools should impart knowledge and prepare students to actively participate in
improving and developing their communities (Dewey, 1899). With a humanistic educational philosophy,
Nel Noddings promotes the relationship between teachers and students, emphasizing care and mutual
respect in a democratic learning environment (Noddings, 1984). Maxine Greene focused on arts education and encouraging critical thinking; Greene saw education as a tool for building a democratic society
(Greene, 2000). Hannah Arendt considered education the foundation of democracy and individual selfrealization, emphasizing education’s role in forming responsible citizens (Arendt, 1958).
This view is supported by contemporary research; for example, Clark and Mayer (2023) presented
case studies of schools that have successfully integrated community service and social issues into their
curricula, promoting social change.
O’Hair and Woods (2024) analyzed the role of effective communication and education in the context
of the ‘post-truth’ world and global challenges through discourse innovation theory. Thus, these studies
clarify that democracy in education is linked to ecological relationships between media, education, and
peace. In addition, the studies also present models, theories, and practical studies to effectively implement democracy linked to ecological relationships in society. However, the studies are limited in their
ability to apply the models to specific local contexts and lack sufficient empirical data to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed theories. Therefore, further research is needed to clarify and expand the
application of these models, especially in Vietnam, a country that needs comprehensive educational
reform.

Third, education needs to develop learners’ thinking skills
Developing critical thinking skills is a central aspect of Dewey’s educational philosophy. In ‘How We
Think’ (Dewey, 2022), he described reflective thinking as a dynamic, persistent process of critically examining beliefs or supposed forms of knowledge in light of the premises that support them and the

COGENT EDUCATION

5

conclusions they lead to. Dewey emphasized that developing fundamental thinking skills is the foundation for fostering critical thinking. Following Rene Descartes’s philosophy, Dewey stressed experience in
the educational process, and both emphasized the role of reason in understanding the world. However,
Descartes, with his skeptical and argumentative method ‘Cogito, ergo sum’, focused on the foundations
of individual knowledge (Descartes, 2024). Similarly, Dewey also valued critical thinking and practical
experience in problem-solving (Dewey, 1938). However, Dewey surpassed Descartes by combining philosophy with social application, education, and the democratic process, emphasizing flexibility and interaction in practice (Dewey, 1938).
Robert Ennis has extensively written about the importance of critical thinking in education. Ennis’s
detailed framework for essential thinking skills complements Dewey’s broader, more philosophical
approach to fostering reflective thought and self-assessment in students (Ennis, 2015). While both
emphasize the importance of critical thinking, Dewey integrates this within a holistic educational framework that includes experiential learning, democratic participation, and social engagement.
Atkinson (2024) examined strategies for nurturing critical thinking in higher education, discussing the
use of reflective journals, peer discussions, and self-assessment tools to promote deep learning and critical thinking. Similarly, Thornhill-Miller et al. (2023) investigated the effectiveness of reflective learning
strategies in online education, demonstrating that incorporating reflective activities in online courses
enhances students’ learning outcomes and critical thinking skills.
Dewey’s educational philosophy is distinguished by its comprehensive approach, integrating experiential
learning, democratic principles, social engagement, and critical thinking. This holistic framework addresses
education’s individual and social dimensions, preparing students for personal success and active and
engaged citizenship. Comparatively, other educational philosophers have made significant contributions to
the field, but often with more specialized focuses. For example, Montessori emphasizes self-directed learning and a prepared environment, Piaget focuses on cognitive development stages, Freire advocates for
education as a means of social transformation, Wibowo et al. (2025) argue that Vygotsky emphasizes the
role of social interactions in mental development, and Ennis (2015) provides a detailed framework for critical thinking skills. While these invaluable contributions, Dewey’s philosophy stands out for integrating these
elements into a unified educational framework. The superiority of Dewey’s philosophy lies in its ability to
adapt to and address the complex and dynamic nature of education in a democratic society. By advocating
for experiential learning, democratic participation, and social engagement, Dewey’s approach prepares students for the challenges of the modern world in a practical and visionary way. Despite Dewey’s comprehensive educational philosophy, current research gaps must be addressed (Dewey, 1933, p. 441- 448). One
significant gap is integrating experiential learning, democratic principles, social engagement, and critical
thinking into modern educational systems. While substantial research supports these components individually, studies must explore how these elements can be cohesively integrated into contemporary curricula
and teaching practices. Additionally, with digital technology and online education, Dewey’s principles must
be adapted to the digital age. Brown et al. (2024) have begun to explore this by discussing using technology to create interactive, experiential learning environments that promote critical thinking. However, more
research is needed to fully understand how digital tools and online platforms can enhance experiential
learning and democratic participation in education (Bourgeois-Bougrine, 2023).
Dewey’s educational philosophy offers a robust framework for creating compelling and inclusive
learning environments. By integrating experiential learning, democratic principles, social engagement,
and critical thinking, educators can prepare students to become competent, engaged citizens capable of
addressing the challenges of the modern world. As educational reform continues globally, Dewey’s principles remain a valuable guide for shaping the future of education. This paper aims to clarify how these
principles can be fully integrated into modern education systems, address gaps in current research, and
provide a comprehensive approach to contemporary education for countries like Vietnam to implement
effective and successful educational reform.

Methods
The study adopts a mixed-methods research approach to ensure a comprehensive and systematic
analysis of Vietnam’s education system and the applicability of Dewey’s educational philosophy.

Secondary data is collected from previous research, reports from international organizations such as the
World Bank (WB) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and official
announcements from the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training and the Government of
Vietnam. This data evaluates the implementation of experiential learning, democratic education, and
educational innovation in Vietnam. Additionally, a systematic analysis of Dewey’s works and those of
preceding and succeeding philosophers is conducted to contextualize the relevance of Deweyan principles in modern educational reforms.
The study employs analytical and synthesis methods to assess key factors influencing Vietnam’s education system. The analytical method involves a systematic literature review, statistical data analysis, and
policy evaluation, allowing for an in-depth examination of human resource quality, systemic limitations,
alignment with labor market demands, and disparities in educational access. Policy analysis and comparative evaluation highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges in Vietnam’s education system,
particularly regarding curriculum shortcomings, an overreliance on theoretical instruction, and regional
inequalities in educational opportunities.
The synthesis method integrates and systematizes key insights to complement the analytical findings,
identifying positive aspects and areas requiring improvement. This method enables the study to develop
a comprehensive framework for educational reform, incorporating experiential learning, democratic classroom participation, critical thinking development, and equitable access to quality education. Combining
these methods ensures a scientifically rigorous and logically structured research process, leading to
evidence-based policy recommendations.
Findings from the study contribute to strategic education reforms aimed at transitioning from passive
to active learning methodologies, enhancing curricula with experiential learning components, integrating
science and technology into teaching, and promoting inclusive education policies. These recommendations align with Vietnam’s broader socio-economic development goals and global integration strategies,
providing a scientifically grounded roadmap for modernizing the country’s education system.

Results
Apply dewey’s experiential educational philosophy to enhance experiential education for
students
Vietnam’s education system has made significant strides in enhancing the quality of human resources,
with a notable increase in the proportion of workers holding degrees or certificates, reaching 28.1% in
2024. This progress reflects a commitment to improving educational standards and aligning them with
labor market demands. However, challenges persist. A substantial portion of the workforce remains inadequately trained, with over 70% of workers untrained (General Statistics Office of Vietnam, 2024). This
gap indicates a misalignment between educational outcomes and the evolving requirements of a modern, flexible, and integrated labor market. One contributing factor is the traditional emphasis on theoretical knowledge over practical skills within the educational curriculum. Experiential and experimental
learning methodologies have not been sufficiently prioritized, leading to graduates who may excel academically but lack the hands-on experience and critical thinking abilities essential for today’s job market.
The lack of experiential education in the Vietnamese education system leads to students lacking practical skills, affecting their competitiveness in the global labor market. According to the World Bank,
Vietnam’s formal education and training system is still heavily theoretical and outdated, failing to meet
the labor market requirements (World Bank, 2020, p. 7). Compared to developed countries, Vietnam is
slow to adopt experiential education methods, leading to students lacking practical skills and critical
thinking. The World Bank report also points out that, in addition to funding constraints, higher education governance lacks information about market needs and incentives to meet those needs (World Bank,
2020, p. 3).
Dewey’s philosophy of experiential education emphasizes the active participation of learners in realworld contexts. He posited, ‘Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself (Dewey, 1916, p.
239), highlighting the necessity of integrating learning with practical experiences. Moreover, he argued,
"We do not learn from experience … we learn from reflecting on experience" (Dewey, 1933, p. 78),

COGENT EDUCATION

stressing the importance of experience. Dewey also believed, "The most important attitude that can be
formed is that of desire to go on learning" (Dewey, 1938, p. 48), that is, experience reinforces lifelong
learning as a cornerstone of education. There is a notable gap in implementing Dewey’s experiential
learning principles in Vietnamese education. The traditional education system in Vietnam has been characterized by a focus on theoretical knowledge, rote memorization, and teacher-centered instruction,
with limited opportunities for students to engage in hands-on, experiential learning activities. This lack
of experiential learning is evident in the limited integration of practical experiences within the curriculum and a predominant emphasis on examination results as measures of academic success. Several factors contribute to this deficiency.

Applying Dewey’s democratic educational philosophy, education and social responsibility, to
building equity in education in Vietnam
Democratic education in Vietnam must expand its understanding of equitable access to quality education, prioritizing resources for urban and rural areas differently. Urban regions benefit from advanced
educational facilities, modern technologies, better English language opportunities, and highly qualified
teachers, while students in rural and mountainous areas face significant disparities. For example, urban
schools offer STEAM education and learner-centered approaches, fostering critical thinking and creativity,
yet these practices remain limited in less-developed areas (Scogin et al., 2023). Dewey’s philosophy
emphasizes accommodating student0 s diverse cultural, experiential, and living conditions, advocating
tailored teaching strategies to enable active knowledge construction (Dewey, 1916, p. 425-428). Teachers
must adapt methods to each learner’s needs rather than rely on passive lecture-based teaching, ensuring
all students can engage meaningfully with education.
Vietnam’s education system exhibits significant disparities across regions, particularly between urban
and rural areas and between lowland and mountainous regions. These disparities manifest in access to
quality education, availability of trained teachers, and educational outcomes. For instance, ethnic minority groups in mountainous areas often have lower educational attainment compared to the Kinh majority in urban centers. A study analyzing data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys
(VHLSS) indicates that ethnic minority children are less likely to attend school and have lower completion rates than their Kinh counterparts. This inequality is attributed to economic constraints, limited
access to educational facilities, and language barriers. Vietnam has made significant progress in improving education quality and reducing inequality. According to the Global Commitment to Reducing
Inequality Index 2024, Vietnam ranked 94 out of 164 countries, demonstrating a strong commitment to
reducing inequality, especially in tax policies and education spending, according to Oxfam (2024).
However, disparities in educational opportunities between regions persist. The average number of years
of schooling for Vietnamese people increased from 9 to 9.6 between 2019 and 2024; however, men
spend 0.7 years more than women, and urban areas spend 2.5 years more than rural areas (General
Statistics Office of Vietnam, 2024). To continue promoting educational equity, Vietnam must focus on
expanding primary education, improving teacher quality, and improving facilities, especially in disadvantaged areas. In the 2023-2024 school year, the country will have 318 ethnic minority boarding schools in
48 provinces and cities, with 103,847 students; the rate of schools meeting national standards is 58.8%
(Ministry of Education & Training, 2024). Continuous investment in the education system, especially in
rural and mountainous areas, is necessary to ensure that all children have access to quality education,
reducing inequality and promoting sustainable development.
Dewey’s democratic ideology in education emphasizes inclusivity, participation, and social consciousness, advocating for an education system that ensures equal opportunities for all students. He asserted
that ‘a democracy is more than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience’ (Dewey, 1916, p. 101). From this perspective, education is about knowledge transmission and fostering individuals who actively engage in society. Dewey emphasized that
education must promote critical thinking, collaboration, and civic engagement, enabling students to
become responsible and informed citizens (Dewey, 1938). His democratic educational philosophy supports student-centered learning environments where learners contribute to decision-making, thus
enhancing autonomy and problem-solving skills (DeJaeghere et al., 2024). In Vietnam, disparities in

8

K. PHAM THI

education persist between urban and rural areas and among different socio-economic groups, leading
to unequal access to quality education (Nham, 2023). Implementing Dewey’s principles could address
these inequalities by fostering an inclusive and participatory learning environment. Adopting studentcentered teaching methods and incorporating experiential learning can empower students from diverse
backgrounds, ensuring they acquire the skills needed for meaningful contributions to society. Studies
indicate democratic education enhances student engagement, motivation, and long-term learning outcomes (Gutmann, 1999). Moreover, providing marginalized groups with a voice in educational decisionmaking aligns with Dewey’s view that education serves as a vehicle for social transformation. While
Vietnam has made progress in expanding education access, challenges remain in ensuring equity in educational quality and participation. By integrating Dewey’s democratic ideals into its education system,
Vietnam can create a more equitable and socially cohesive learning environment that prepares students
for active civic participation and lifelong learning (Dewey, 1958).
In the Vietnamese education system, the mention of civic responsibility in society is still limited.
According to statistics, in 2022, only 40% of general schools integrated civic education into the curriculum (Pham et al., 2023). This shows that the current state of Vietnamese education has not emphasized
the role of citizens. Dewey said: ‘Education is not only preparation for present life but also future civic
responsibility’ (Dewey, 1916, p. 45). Dewey’s education requires integrating civic values into the curriculum to develop social awareness and personal responsibility, while Vietnamese education has not yet
fully implemented this.

Applying Dewey’s innovative thinking to help learners in Vietnam be proactive, positive, and
autonomous in learning
Vietnam’s education system has traditionally emphasized rote memorization over critical thinking and
innovation, leading to a workforce that may lack the creativity and adaptability required in today’s rapidly evolving labor market. The Fourth Industrial Revolution demands a workforce proficient in science,
technology, and innovative problem-solving, particularly as digital enterprises expand and the need for
digital skills intensifies (Dighliya, 2025). Despite ongoing educational reforms, challenges persist in aligning Vietnam’s educational outcomes with labor market demands. A 2024 report highlights that while
higher education institutions have initiated solutions to prepare human resources for the semiconductor
chip industry, the overall integration of critical thinking and innovation in curricula remains limited
(Ministry of Education & Training, 2024). This gap is evident in employer feedback; many express concerns over graduates’ lack of practical skills and innovative capabilities, which are essential in high-tech
industries (Le, 2023).
Dewey’s educational philosophy underscores the importance of experiential learning and critical
thinking. He asserted, ‘If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow’
(Dewey, 1916, p. 167). This perspective highlights the necessity for educational systems to evolve in
response to societal changes. Dewey also emphasized that ‘education must be conceived as a continuing reconstruction of experience; that the process and the goal of education are the same thing’
(Dewey, 1958, p. 7), advocating for an education that fosters continuous learning and adaptability.
Vietnam’s education system must integrate critical thinking, creativity, and practical skills into its curriculum to help students bridge the gap between learning outcomes and labor market demands. This
includes adopting student-centered teaching methods, promoting problem-solving activities, and
enhancing collaboration between educational institutions and industry. With positive innovations in academic content, curricula, and teaching methods, students have the necessary competencies to succeed
in a dynamic, technology-driven global economy.

Discussion
Current research on experiential education, democratic education, civic education, and innovative education has continued and expanded on Dewey’s philosophy. Contemporary philosophers such as Nel
Noddings and Bell Hooks emphasize the importance of teacher-student relationships, inclusion, and
equality in the learning environment (Hooks, 1994; Noddings, 1984). New research shows that

COGENT EDUCATION

experiential and democratic education approaches have been successfully applied in countries such as
Finland and Canada, where education systems that focus on project-based learning and developing critical thinking skills have resulted in higher student success and teacher satisfaction (OECD, 2023). For
example, Finland regularly tops global education rankings due to its application of Dewey’s principles of
active learning and social interaction (Sahlberg, 2015). The limitations of pre-Dewey studies are often
the lack of widespread application in different cultural contexts and the difficulty in measuring the
effectiveness of democratic education. However, Dewey is still predicted to continue to have a strong
influence in the future, especially in promoting inclusive education and sustainable development,
emphasizing the flexibility and adaptability of educational systems to social changes (Biesta, 2024).
Vietnam’s education system faces significant challenges in fostering experiential learning, democratic
participation, and innovative thinking among students, essential to meeting the demands of the global
labor market and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Traditional teaching methods, characterized by rote
memorization and teacher-centered instruction, dominate Vietnamese classrooms, limiting students’ critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. This educational approach contrasts sharply with the competencies required in today’s workforce, where creativity, adaptability, and technological proficiency are
paramount.
Dewey’s educational philosophy, emphasizing experiential learning and democracy in education,
offers a compelling framework for addressing these deficiencies. Dewey advocated for education as a
process of living, not merely preparation for future life, asserting that ‘education is not preparation for
life; education is life itself’ (Dewey, 1916, p. 239). He emphasized engaging students in active problemsolving and critical thinking through real-world experiences, fostering intrinsic motivation and a lifelong
love of learning. Dewey also believed education should be a democratic process involving students in
decision-making to cultivate responsibility and active citizenship.
While other educational theories exist, Dewey’s integration of experiential learning with democratic
principles uniquely addresses the current needs of Vietnamese education. For instance, Paulo Freire’s
critical pedagogy emphasizes dialogue and critical consciousness but lacks Dewey’s focus on learning
through experience (Freire, 2020). Similarly, Jean Piaget’s cognitive development theory centers on
stages of intellectual growth without explicitly incorporating the social and democratic aspects that
Dewey champions (Ottavi, 2024).
Previous studies have highlighted the need for educational reform in Vietnam, particularly in adopting
student-centered learning and enhancing critical thinking skills. However, a paucity of research focuses
explicitly on implementing Dewey’s experiential and democratic education principles within the
Vietnamese context. This study addresses this gap by exploring how Deweyan philosophy can be operationalized to transform teaching practices and curricula in Vietnam, aligning them more closely with global educational standards and labor market requirements.
The findings suggest that integrating Dewey’s principles could lead to a more dynamic and responsive education system in Vietnam. By emphasizing experiential learning, students can develop practical
skills and adaptability, essential for the rapidly evolving job market influenced by Industry 4.0. Moreover,
fostering democratic participation in classrooms can enhance students’ sense of agency, collaboration,
and civic responsibility, aligning with the societal needs of a modern, democratic nation.
The study recognizes several limitations in implementing Deweyan educational principles in Vietnam,
including resistance to change due to deeply entrenched traditional teaching practices and the need for
extensive teacher training. To effectively transition to an education system inspired by Dewey’s philosophy, future research should prioritize the development of targeted strategies for teacher education, policy reforms, and pilot programs that facilitate gradual adoption.
Currently, Vietnam is undergoing efforts to modernize its education system. However, several critical
challenges hinder this innovation, primarily in teacher training, resource availability, and resistance to
change. Teacher training programs often lack sufficient preparation in innovative pedagogical methods,
leaving educators ill-equipped to adopt and sustain new teaching approaches (Slattery, 2024).
Additionally, many schools’ inadequate funding and resource constraints further impede the integration
of modern educational technologies and active learning strategies (Tri, 2024). Furthermore, cultural
resistance to change remains a significant barrier, as traditional methods dominate the education system, making it challenging to introduce and institutionalize progressive reforms (Neofotistos &

10

K. PHAM THI

Papastathis, 2025). These challenges underscore the need for a comprehensive approach that includes
reforms in teacher education, increased investment in educational infrastructure, and a fundamental shift
in mindset toward embracing educational innovation.
Applying Dewey’s educational philosophy to Vietnam’s educational reform efforts could provide a
transformative framework. Dewey’s emphasis on experiential learning, democratic participation, and critical thinking fosters a more dynamic, student-centered learning environment. His principles align with
the pressing need for an education system that equips students with problem-solving skills, adaptability,
and autonomy, essential qualities for the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. To ensure successful implementation, Vietnam must prioritize teacher professional development, promote active learning methodologies, and create policies that support participatory and experience-based education. By
doing so, the country can move towards an education system that modernizes learning and prepares
students to engage effectively in the global workforce.
First, implementing Dewey’s experiential learning principles can potentially drive significant innovation in
Vietnam’s education system. Vietnamese educators can enhance student engagement and knowledge
retention by shifting from traditional rote memorization methods to more interactive, hands-on learning
approaches. Research has demonstrated that connecting theoretical concepts to practical applications
improves learning outcomes (Thornhill-Miller et al., 2024). For instance, schools incorporating projectbased learning and field trips into their curricula have reported increased student motivation and participation (Nguyen et al., 2023).
Secondly, Dewey’s advocacy for democratic education is expected to influence the operational framework
of educational institutions in Vietnam. Schools that adopt participatory teaching methods - encouraging
students to express their opinions and engage in decision-making - have observed positive effects on
student autonomy and leadership development. A democratic classroom environment fosters a sense of
responsibility and citizenship, preparing students to be active and informed members of society
(Atkinson, 2024; Dewey, 1916). Empirical studies indicate that students in schools implementing democratic educational principles exhibit higher critical thinking and problem-solving abilities (DeJaeghere
et al., 2024).
According to Dewey, Vietnamese education must integrate experiential learning methods into the
curriculum to educate students on civic responsibility (Dewey, 1916). Experiential learning methods can
include project-based learning, where students participate in real-life projects related to the community,
such as improving public areas, organizing social events, or solving local environmental problems. In
addition, volunteer learning methods also help students directly participate in community service activities, thereby developing teamwork skills and personal responsibility. Collaboration with social organizations requires schools and universities to build partnerships with NGOs, businesses, and local
government agencies. These organizations can provide practical learning environments by organizing
internships, seminars, and student mentorship programs. For example, students can participate in projects of non-profit organizations such as disaster relief, community education, or sustainable development, thereby better understanding their roles and responsibilities in society. Vietnamese education can
use technology platforms such as specialized social networks and online learning management systems
to connect students with international projects. In addition, participating in international exchange programs, global project competitions, and crowdfunding platforms to support social projects is also an
effective way. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology can also be used to create
simulation models of social situations, helping students better understand the impact of their actions on
the global community.
Third, applying Dewey’s educational philosophy to the Vietnamese education system can significantly
improve students’ critical thinking and creativity. Dewey emphasized that ‘democracy is not merely a form
of government; it is primarily a way of life, of shared experience’ (Dewey, 1916, p. 101). This suggests
that education should create a democratic learning environment where students can participate, ask
questions, and develop independent thinking. However, the Vietnamese education system is still heavily
dependent on rote learning and lacks practical experience activities. According to the Ministry of
Education and Training report, in the 2023–2024 school year, innovation in teaching methods and
assessment is still one of the key tasks to be implemented (Ministry of Education & Training, 2023). This
shows the need to apply new educational methods to meet the demands of the labor market in the

COGENT EDUCATION

11

context of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. To do this, Vietnam must focus on training teachers in advanced
teaching methods, facilitating students to participate in experiential learning activities, and promoting a
democratic learning environment. As Dewey pointed out, ‘the only freedom of lasting importance is that
of the mind, that is, the freedom to observe and judge for purposes of intrinsic value’ (Dewey, 1938, p.
61). Applying this philosophy can help Vietnamese students develop critical and creative thinking skills
and better meet global labor market demands.
Dewey’s emphasis on education as a tool for social reform aligns with Vietnam’s broader educational
and social development objectives. Integrating Dewey’s ideas into the curriculum allows educators to
address key social issues such as inequality and sustainable development. For example, incorporating
social justice topics into classroom discussions raises students’ awareness and empowers them to take
meaningful action within their communities (Cao & Vu, 2023). This approach has proven effective in cultivating a socially conscious generation capable of addressing contemporary challenges.
As Dewey advocates, a learner-centered educational approach emphasizes students’ active role in
constructing knowledge rather than passively receiving information from teachers. This perspective
encourages students to leverage their experiences to develop unique viewpoints, fostering deeper
engagement in the learning process. Additionally, democracy in education necessitates equitable
resource distribution, including allocating well-trained teachers to rural and mountainous regions, investment in infrastructure, and providing teaching equipment and student support policies. Such efforts are
essential to ensuring educational equity across diverse geographical areas (Sahlberg, 2021).
The successful implementation of Dewey’s educational philosophy also requires substantial reforms in
teacher training programs. Educators must participate in professional development programs to acquire
the skills to implement experiential and democratic learning methodologies. Consequently, comprehensive teacher training initiatives have been developed, focusing on modern pedagogical strategies and
continuous professional growth (Ho & Dimmock, 2023). Enhancing teacher training quality directly
impacts overall educational effectiveness, as well-prepared teachers are more adept at employing
innovative teaching techniques that benefit student learning outcomes.
Adopting Dewey’s educational philosophy in Vietnam presents several challenges despite its benefits.
Resistance to pedagogical innovation - particularly from educators accustomed to traditional teaching
methods - remains a significant obstacle. Additionally, resource constraints in certain regions pose further difficulties in implementing experiential and democratic learning strategies. To ensure the sustainability of these educational reforms, continuous support and investment from educational authorities are
necessary (O’Leary et al.,2023).
Applying Dewey’s educational philosophy in Vietnam can enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and social responsibility. By promoting experiential learning, fostering democratic participation, and
integrating social issues into education, Dewey’s principles contribute to the modernization and
improvement of the Vietnamese education system.

Conclusion
Vietnam’s current educational framework exhibits notable limitations, particularly in providing students
with experiential learning opportunities and fostering democratic engagement within the educational
process. Traditional pedagogical methods, characterized by rote memorization and teacher-centered
instruction, dominate the landscape, restricting students’ active participation and critical thinking development. This conventional approach contrasts sharply with Dewey’s educational philosophy, which
emphasizes experiential learning and democratic education as pivotal to cultivating autonomous and
reflective individuals.
Dewey posited that "education is not preparation for life; education is life itself" (Dewey, 1916, p.
239), underscoring the necessity for education to be deeply intertwined with real-life experiences. He
further asserted, "We do not learn from experience … we learn from reflecting on experience" (Dewey,
1933, p. 78), highlighting the critical role of reflection in the learning process. Moreover, Dewey believed
that ‘a democracy is more than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience’ (Dewey, 1916, p. 101), advocating for educational environments that
promote democratic participation and collaborative learning.

Recent studies indicate that integrating experiential learning and democratic principles into education
enhances student engagement, critical thinking, and adaptability skills essential for the modern workforce (Dewey, 2024). However, the Vietnamese education system has slowly adopted these progressive
methodologies. For instance, a 2023 report by the Ministry of Education and Training revealed that only
15% of higher education institutions have incorporated experiential learning components into their curricula, reflecting a significant gap in educational practice (Ministry of Education & Training, 2023).
This research contributes to Vietnamese educational philosophy by illuminating the disparities
between current practices and Dewey’s ideals. It underscores the imperative for systemic reforms prioritizing experiential and democratic education to better prepare students for the complexities of the global labor market and the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
To actualize these reforms, Vietnam must undertake several strategic initiatives: Curriculum Overhaul
that is redesigned educational programs to incorporate experiential learning opportunities, such as
project-based assignments, internships, and community engagement projects, facilitating the practical
application of theoretical knowledge; Teacher training enhancement that is investing in comprehensive
professional development programs that equip educators with the skills to implement student-centered
and democratic teaching methodologies effectively. Policy development establishes policies that support
and incentivize the adoption of Dewey’s educational principles, ensuring alignment with national educational goals and labor market needs. Cultural shift promotion fosters a cultural shift within academic
institutions that value and practice democratic participation, encouraging students to participate actively
in their learning journeys. By embracing these strategies, Vietnam can bridge the gap between its current educational practices and the progressive ideals that Dewey espoused, thereby enhancing education’s quality and relevance in the context of a rapidly evolving global landscape.
