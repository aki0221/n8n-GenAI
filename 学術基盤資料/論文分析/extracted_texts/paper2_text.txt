Because of the complexity of real-world problems, large-scale group decision making has
become a research topic of great interest in the ﬁeld of decision science. Differences of
opinion in a large group are highly likely. Sometimes, decision makers are unwilling to adjust their opinions to promote consensus. It is hence necessary to establish a consensus
model for the effective management of opinion differences and non-cooperative behaviors.
More importantly, the credibility of the adjustment information must be ensured. In this
paper, we present a conﬁdence consensus-based model for large-scale group decision making that provides a novel approach to addressing non-cooperative behaviors. First, some
new concepts are proposed, including the collective adjustment suggestion and rationality
degree. Then, we combine the rationality and non-cooperation of the adjustment information to construct the concept of a conﬁdence level. This conﬁdence level measures the
impartiality and objectivity of the adjustment information and is the basis for managing
non-cooperative behaviors. We then establish a mechanism for addressing non-cooperative
behaviors. Finally, we present a case study that illustrates that the proposed model is feasible and effective. A comparative analysis reveals the features and advantages of this model
for managing large-scale group decision making.

1. Introduction
Group decision making (GDM) aims to achieve a common solution for a decision problem in which two or more decision
makers (DMs) participate, and it has been paid an increasing amount of attention [1,3,9,23,28]. Traditional GDM is a type of
group discussion and decision process in which the number of DMs is small (e.g., three to ﬁve people), and the complexity is
often not very high (e.g., a car purchase decision for a family). In GDM for public-interest decisions, however, a large number
of DMs with different interests and knowledge structures must be involved. Research into large-scale GDM (LSGDM) is a new
area in the ﬁeld of decision making. LSGDM problems are generally characterized by some or all the following four features
[4,7,10,20,30,41]: (a) The group usually involves a large number of DMs from different sectors and professional ﬁelds. (b)
Obtaining a high-consensus solution necessitates the implementation of a consensus reaching process (CRP). (c) The social

networks of the DMs and the evolution of their opinions are considered. (d) DMs often have individual concerns about
alternatives, and thus they adopt heterogeneous preference representation structures to express their preferences. Note that
the number of DMs in current LSGDM problems varies from dozens to thousands [32]. Xu et al. [34] and Zhang et al.
[41] believe that if the number of DMs in a group exceeds 11, the group is a large group, whereas Liu et al. [17] insists that
this number should be more than 20. In this study, to include all the research on consensus measures and mechanisms for
managing non-cooperative behaviors in the CRP, we employ the ﬁrst and second characteristics above to deﬁne LSGDM.
Clustering is an effective approach to organizing and managing a large group because it can divide a large group into
small-scale subgroups. Many clustering methods have been proposed such as K-means algorithm [14,32], fuzzy clustering
algorithm [20], grey clustering algorithm [16], and vector space-based [33] clustering method. Clustering in LSGDM is typically based on the similarity of DMs’ opinions. If the opinions of certain DMs are suﬃciently similar (i.e., over a certain
threshold), these DMs are assigned to the same subgroup. This classiﬁcation produces a hierarchical structure. The outer
layer represents the interaction between subgroups and the inner layer represents the discussion among the members of
each subgroup. The coordination among subgroups does not need to consider the internal members of the subgroup; the
members in a subgroup form a uniﬁed subgroup opinion through discussion and coordination. Generally, the clustering
structure does not change once it has been determined [34,35] because this helps the members in each subgroup to establish trust feelings and form a uniﬁed opinion. In contrast, Wu and Xu [32] and Zhang et al. [41] studied consensus models
in which the clusters are allowed to change. This study follows Xu et al.’s research [34] on classifying large-scale DMs and
uses the cluster as a basic unit once the clustering structure has been determined.
Generally, both of the two processes are used to address LSGDM problems: the consensus process and the selection process [34]. Reaching a consensus is a dynamic and iterative group discussion process in which some DMs must make compromises. Unanimity is diﬃcult to attain, and “soft” consensus is widely used in CRPs [13]. To date, various consensus reaching
models (CRMs) have been proposed that address different decision-making problems: (1) GDM with linguistic assessments
[2,5,11,12,18,21,25,31,40,42,43], (2) LSGDM [15,19,20,24,32,34,35,41], (3) GDM that considers the non-cooperative behaviors
[8,10,20,34], and (4) GDM under a social network environment [6,26,27,29]. With respect to non-cooperative behaviors in
particular, Palomares et al. [20] proposed a weight penalizing method that aims to reduce the weights of non-cooperating
experts’ preferences, Xu et al. [34] developed a consensus model based on the level of non-cooperation to address noncooperative behaviors, and Dong et al. [8] introduced three types of non-cooperative behaviors, in which some DMs express
their opinions dishonestly or refuse to change their opinions to further their own interests. Based on the above literature,
we observe the following information about the management of non-cooperative behaviors.
(1) Research on non-cooperative behaviors is still in its inceptive stage, and there are few studies in the literature, particularly those that consider the LSGDM environment.
(2) Few studies have considered the rationality of the adjustment information provided by non-cooperative DMs (or subgroups) and used it as a reference for managing non-cooperative behaviors. Hence, this is a research issue that should
be addressed.
An LSGDM problem often involves multiple DMs, and they may have different attitudes toward compromise to achieve
a consensus. Some DMs are in favor of adjusting their opinions, whereas others refuse to compromise or make very small
compromises. Non-cooperative behaviors may seriously affect the decision process and the ﬁnal decision result; hence, it
is necessary to respond appropriately. In addition to the CRMs for managing non-cooperative behaviors listed above, Pelta
and Yager [22] and Yager [38,39] considered non-cooperative behaviors in the selection process of GDM problems, but not
in the CRP. Managing non-cooperative behaviors in the CRP helps to better adjust the opinions of non-cooperative DMs
and further inﬂuence the decision result. We prefer to manage non-cooperative behaviors and achieve agreement among
the DMs’ opinions before applying the selection process. Therefore, in this study, we continue the approach of [34] and
propose a novel consensus model for managing non-cooperative behaviors in LSGDM that combines the non-cooperation
and rationality of the adjustment information.
The CRP consists of two core elements: a consensus measure and feedback adjustment. There are usually two ways to
measure consensus: the ﬁrst is based on the distance to the group opinion [34,40] and the second is based on the distances
among DMs’ opinions [8,31,42]. Different consensus measures lead to different consensus processes and decision results.
Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the suitability of each measure for a particular application.
The contributions of this paper are as follows.
Different consensus measures are deﬁned and their advantages and disadvantages are compared.
A mechanism for addressing non-cooperative behaviors is proposed. First, we insert an interaction step in the management of non-cooperative behaviors that effectively enables DMs to provide better adjustment coeﬃcients. We combine
the levels of rationality and non-cooperation to construct the conﬁdence level of a cluster’s adjustment coeﬃcient. By
referring to the conﬁdence level, non-cooperative behaviors can be better managed.
• An algorithm for the conﬁdence consensus-based model for LSGDM is presented that incorporates the proposed mechanism.
• A detailed comparative analysis of the conﬁdence consensus-based model with other models and a simulation that summarizes the characteristics of the CRP are presented.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review the basic concepts of non-cooperative
behaviors. In Section 3, we propose the conﬁdence consensus-based model to address non-cooperative behaviors. A case
study is presented in Section 4 to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed model. In Section 5, we compare our
model with existing consensus models, discuss the results obtained using different consensus measures, and analyze the
results of setting consensus thresholds and other parameters to different values. We draw our conclusions in Section 6.
2. Concepts related to non-cooperative behaviors
Non-cooperative behaviors exist widely in LSGDM because DMs come from different professions and industries and hence
may represent different interests. Non-cooperative behaviors can be categorized as follows: (a) an expert or an experienced
person who insists that his/her opinion is right but has no private interests; (b) a leader who thinks his/her opinion is that
of authority, where there may be private interests; (c) a noteworthy and independent person who provides a view that
is often out of the ordinary and insists that his/her opinion is innovative; and (d) a stakeholder with private interests. In
this study, we focus on the management of the ﬁrst type of DM. In future research, we will study the other three types of
non-cooperative DMs.
There are typically two approaches to addressing non-cooperative behaviors [34]: a weight adjustment, used to decrease
a DM’s inﬂuence to achieve a greater consensus, and an opinion adjustment, used to make a DM’s opinion closer to the
group’s opinion.
3. Conﬁdence consensus-based model that considers non-cooperative behaviors
In Section 3.1, we introduce different rules for computing consensus measures. In Section 3.2, we propose a mechanism
for addressing non-cooperative behaviors in LSGDM. We present the algorithm for the conﬁdence consensus-based model
in Section 3.3.
Given an LSGDM problem, let X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xm } be a ﬁnite set of m alternatives, A = {a1 , a2 , . . . , an } be a set of n atn
tributes, and ω = (ω1 , ω2 , . . . , ωn )T be the weight vector of the attributes, where
j=1 ω j = 1, 0 ≤ ω j ≤ 1 ( j = 1, 2, . . . , n).
Let E = {e1 , e2 , . . . , eq } (q ≥ 20) be a set of q DMs. Each DM expresses its opinion using numerical decision matrix V l =
[vli j ]m×n , where vli j represents the opinion of DM el on alternative xi ∈ X with respect to attribute aj ∈ A. Before entering the
CRP, individual decision matrix Vl should be normalized to standardized decision matrix Rl = [ril j ]m×n , where [36]

ril j =

vli j − min{vli j }
l

max{vli j } − min{vli j }

ril j =

for beneﬁt attributes and

l

max{vli j } − vli j

for cost attributes.

Clustering the DMs’ opinions is the basis for analyzing a large group. In this study, we adopt the clustering method in
[33] to classify a large number of DMs into K(1 ≤ K ≤ q) subgroups (the clustering method is described in the supplementary
materials). The weight vector of the clusters λ = (λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λK )T is obtained such that

where nk is the number of DMs in cluster gk . Clearly, 0 ≤ λk ≤ 1(k = 1, 2, . . . , K ) and Kk=1 λk = 1. The cluster decision matrix

can be obtained, i.e., Rk = (rikj )m×n , where rikj = (1/nk ) l=1

3.1. Consensus measures
Two methods for calculating consensus measures exist: the ﬁrst is based on the distance to the group opinion and the
second is based on the distances between individual opinions. In practice, consensus measures can be classiﬁed into the
following three categories.
(1) Consensus measure based on the distance to the group opinion using an average operator (CM-I):

selection process can be followed; otherwise, the CRP should be applied to manage the opinion differences. In Section 5.4,
we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the above three consensus measures.

3.2. Mechanism for managing non-cooperative behaviors
In LSGDM after clustering, it is common for some clusters to adopt a non-cooperative attitude toward opinion adjustment. Managing these non-cooperative behaviors is a challenge but also an important part of the process of consensus
building. Inspired by the research in [20,34], this study employs three phases to address non-cooperative behaviors: identiﬁcation, interaction, and proper modiﬁcation.
3.2.1. Identiﬁcation rule for non-cooperative behaviors
Step 1. Detect and determine the most deviant individual opinion.
Suppose that the opinion of cluster gk∗ deviates most from those of the other clusters. This cluster can be determined
using the following formulas:

Step 2. Cluster gk∗ provides the adjustment coeﬃcient and the other clusters provide the related adjustment suggestions.
Because of the complexity of decision making, the adjustment coeﬃcient and adjustment suggestions are given as in∗

terval numbers. Suppose that the adjustment coeﬃcient is η̄k ,t = [ηLk ,t , ηU k ,t ], where ηU k ,t and ηLk ,t are the upper

and lower limits of η̄ , respectively, such that 0 ≤ η

that 0 ≤ η

Step 3. Calculate the collective adjustment suggestion.

Use the probability degree of two interval numbers to compute the degree of non-cooperation of adjusting coeﬃcient

∗

η̄k ,t [34]. If p(η̄k ,t ≥ η̄k →k ,t ) = 1, then this indicates that gk∗ is a completely cooperative subgroup; otherwise, gk∗ is regarded as a non-cooperative subgroup.
Note that only using the degree of non-cooperation to punish non-cooperative behaviors is likely to induce the cluster
to deliberately reduce it and reduce the rationality of the adjustment coeﬃcient. Therefore, we should further measure the
rationality of the adjustment coeﬃcient.
Based on the majority principle, an adjustment coeﬃcient that is closer to the collective adjustment suggestion is more
reasonable. Thus, using the similarity [37] to compute the proximity of the adjustment coeﬃcient to the collective adjust∗
∗
ment suggestion, we can measure the rationality T k ,t (0 ≤ T k ,t ≤ 1 ) of the given adjustment coeﬃcient. Appendix A presents
∗
the deﬁnition of the similarity of two interval numbers. Values of T k ,t closer to one indicate an adjustment coeﬃcient that
is more similar to the collective adjustment suggestion.
3.2.2. Interaction and discussion
If cluster gk∗ is determined to be a non-cooperative subgroup, then more in-depth discussions can be conducted between
gk∗ and the other clusters. Two scenarios are presented: (a) cluster gk∗ is urged to make its adjustment coeﬃcient closer to
the collective adjustment suggestion and (b) cluster gk∗ is impelled to reduce its degree of non-cooperation to obtain greater
∗
∗
∗
consensus. After discussion and interaction, cluster gk∗ changes its adjustment coeﬃcient η̄k ,t to z η̄k ,t , where z η̄k ,t is an
∗ ,t
∗ ,t
z
k
z
k
interval number. Then, the non-cooperation and rationality are recalculated, denoted by τ
and T
, respectively. It is
noted that cluster gk∗ may has the option of not changing its adjustment coeﬃcient.
3.2.3. Proper modiﬁcation
Combining the value of rationality with that of non-cooperation, we can construct a new concept called the conﬁdence
level to measure quantitatively the extent to which cluster gk∗ can provide a rational adjustment coeﬃcient. The conﬁdence
level represents three aspects: (a) other clusters’ feelings that the given adjustment coeﬃcient can be trusted; (b) the reﬂection of honesty and emotional expression of cluster gk∗ in terms of opinion adjustment; and (c) an indication of the
understanding of cluster gk∗ of the decision problem and its impartiality in the decision-making process.
∗

∗

∗

∗

Deﬁnition 2. The conﬁdence level of the given adjustment coeﬃcient is the mapping f : z τ k ,t , z T k ,t → ς k ,t (ς k ,t ∈ [0, 1] ).
∗

∗

Deﬁnition 3. A weighted geometric averaging operator is used to describe the mapping f and obtain fWG : z τ k ,t , z T k ,t →
∗
ς k ,t , such that

 ∗

 ∗ ν
∗
∗ 
∗ μ
ς k ,t = fWG z τ k ,t , z T k ,t = 1 − z τ k ,t WG × z T k ,t WG ,

(8)

where μWG and ν WG are control coeﬃcients that deﬁne the relative weight of the non-cooperation and rationality, respectively, such that μWG , ν WG ∈ [0, 1] and μWG + νWG = 1.
The following theorem can easily be determined.
∗

Theorem 1. If μWG , ν WG = 0, then ς k ,t ∈ [0, 1].
∗

∗

∗

∗

Theorem 2. If μWG = 0, then Eq. (8) changes to ς k ,t =z T k ,t . In this case, the conﬁdence level only depends on the rationality of
the adjustment coeﬃcient.
Theorem 3. If νWG = 0, then Eq. (8) changes to ς k ,t =z τ k ,t . In this case, the conﬁdence level only relies on the non-cooperation
of the adjustment coeﬃcient.
Commonly, we set 0 < μWG , ν WG < 1. Speciﬁcally,
∗

(1) if ς k ,t = 0, then the conﬁdence level of the adjustment coeﬃcient is zero. This can result from the following:
∗
a) z τ k ,t = 1: this indicates that the adjustment coeﬃcient cannot satisfy the minimum requirement of the collective
adjustment suggestion; thus, cluster gk∗ is regarded as a completely non-cooperative subgroup.
∗
b) z T k ,t = 0: This indicates that the adjustment coeﬃcient deviates far from the collective adjustment suggestion.
Whether cluster gk∗ is regarded as a completely non-cooperative subgroup or the adjustment is too deviant, the DMs
in cluster gk∗ should be advised to exit the decision process to ensure decision quality and decision-making eﬃciency.
In this study, we focus on the category of the non-cooperating experts; hence, the cause of non-cooperative behaviors
or very deviant adjustments is a poor understanding of the decision problem or subjectively persistent with few
private interests.
∗
(2) If ς k ,t ∈ (0, 1 ), then the conﬁdence level can be used as the basis of the weight adjustment.
A DM’s weights reﬂect its inﬂuence on the group opinion. By modifying the weights, the inﬂuence is adjusted. When
confronted with non-cooperative clusters, we can reduce their weight to reduce their impact so as to promote consensus.
Deﬁnition 4. The weight penalty function is deﬁned as
z

λk ,t+1 = χ t · ς k ,t · λk ,t ,

tions χ k ,t ≥ 1 and χ k ,t · ς k ,t < 1. The ﬁrst condition ensures that each DM’s opinion can be effectively expressed, including
the DMs of the non-cooperative subgroup, which is in accordance with the principle of cautious handling of and appropriate
respect for non-cooperative behaviors. The second condition ensures that non-cooperative behaviors are eﬃciently managed.

Clearly, χ t ≥ 1 and χ t · ς k ,t < 1.

show ﬁve independent sub-graphs, and Fig. 1(f) shows these ﬁve graphs overlapped as a single graph.
From the results in Fig. 1, we make the following observations:
(1) The simulation results presented in Fig. 1(b)–(d) are similar in shape.
(2) Each graph in Fig. 1(a)–(e) has a maximum point. This ﬁnding conforms to Theorem 1. Further, in Fig. 1(b)–(d), the
three maximum values correspond to the case in which all the values of non-cooperation are close to 0.5 and all the
values of rationality are close to one (points (0.492, 0.969, 0.798) in Fig 1(b), (0.503, 0.989, 0.701) in Fig 1(c), and
(0.489, 0.959, 0.617) in Fig 1(d)).
(3) When we set 0 < μWG , ν WG < 1, the relationship between the conﬁdence level and degrees of rationality and noncooperation can be described as one of two cases.
a) Partially positive relationship: The rationality is strongly positively correlated with the conﬁdence level, whereas the
non-cooperation is strongly negatively correlated with the conﬁdence level; that is, the conﬁdence level increases
when the rationality increases and the non-cooperation decreases.
b) Completely positive relationship: The conﬁdence level increases with the increase in rationality and the increase in
non-cooperation.
(4) Figs. 1(a) and (e) are two special scenarios that correspond to Theorems 2 and 3, respectively.
Note 1. If the adjustment coeﬃcient and collective adjustment suggestion are expressed as interval numbers, then a completely negative relationship may emerge when different methods are used to calculate the rationality and non-cooperation.
The completely negative relationship is deﬁned as follows: the conﬁdence level decreases when the rationality increases
and non-cooperation increases. In future research, we will study the inﬂuence of different measurement formulas for rationality and non-cooperation on the relationship between the adjustment coeﬃcient, collective adjustment suggestion, and
conﬁdence level.
3.3. Algorithm for the conﬁdence consensus-based model in LSGDM
The proposed consensus model in this study aims to obtain a common decision result with a suﬃciently high level of
group consensus among DMs. The algorithm for this conﬁdence consensus model is summarized as follows (also see Fig. 2).

4. Case study
We use the case in [35] to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The decision information is summarized
as follows: Emergency shelter construction is a priority task for post-earthquake recovery. Four types of materials can be
selected to construct emergency shelters: tents (x1 ), plastic sheeting (x2 ), waste wood (x3 ), and light steel (x4 ). Three aspects
are considered: availability (a1 ), convenience (a2 ), and perceived safety (a3 ). These attribute values are typically given on a
0–100 scale and the weight vector of the attributes is ω = (0.25, 0.5, 0.25)T . Twenty-ﬁve experts el (l = 1, 2, . . . , 25) are
invited to participate in the emergency decision process. Assume that the acceptable consensus threshold is GCI = 0.75.
The 25 experts offer their preferences over the alternatives with respect to attributes. The normalized individual decision
matrices are shown in Appendix B in [35].

Below, we apply the algorithm presented in Section 3.3 to select the best alternative. The experts decide to use CM-I to
measure the consensus levels and set μWG = νWG = 0.5. The reason why CM-I is chosen will be explained in Section 5.4.
Input: normalized individual decision matrices Rl (l = 1, 2, . . . , 25 ), weight vector of the attributes ω, and acceptable consensus threshold GCI = 0.75.
Output: ﬁnal number of iterations, ﬁnal group decision matrix, and alternative ranking.
Step 1. Classify the 25 experts into several subgroups.
Using the clustering method presented in [33], the large group is divided into ﬁve smaller clusters (see Table 1). The
initial weight vector of the clusters is obtained as λ0 = (0.153, 0.055, 0.393, 0.006, 0.393)T . Let t = 0.
Step 2. Compute the temporal group decision matrix.
Aggregate the temporal clusters’ decision matrices to obtain the temporal group matrix

that there are large differences among the opinions of the clusters. Hence, CRP should be used.
Step 4. Consensus reaching process.

(i) First consensus iteration.

Because C LCM−I
= mink {C LCM−I
}, g4 is the furthest from the group opinion. Cluster g4 provides the adjustment coeﬃcient

,

of η̄ = [0.1, 0.15]. Other clusters give their suggestions regarding the adjustment of its opinion, i.e., η̄1→4,0 = [0.4, 0.6],
η̄2→4,0 = [0.5, 0.8], η̄3→4,0 = [0.3, 0.4], and η̄5→4,0 = [0.2, 0.4]. The collective adjustment suggestion is ηˆ 4,0 = [0.287, 0.453].
The mechanism for managing non-cooperative behaviors is hence employed.

a) Identiﬁcation of non-cooperative behaviors: Because τ 4,0 = 1 > 0, cluster g4 can be regarded as a completely noncooperative subgroup.
b) Interaction and discussion: Cluster g4 changes its adjustment coeﬃcient to z η̄4,0 = [0.2, 0.25].
c) Proper modiﬁcation: The rationality is calculated as z T 4,0 = 0. Thus, the conﬁdence level is ς 4,0 = 0. To ensure the quality
and eﬃciency of decision making, the single member that makes up cluster g4 is advised to exit the decision process.
The weight vector of clusters is updated to λ1 = (0.154, 0.056, 0.395, 0.395)T . The updated consensus levels become

C ICM−I

= 0.720 < GCI.
Thus, after the ﬁrst iteration, differences remain among the clusters’ opinions.
(ii) Second consensus iteration.
2,1
k,1
Because C LCM−I
= mink {C LCM−I
}, this means that g2 has an opinion with the largest difference from the group opinion.
Cluster g2 provides the adjustment coeﬃcient η̄2,1 = [0.3, 0.5]. Other clusters provide their suggestions regarding the adjustment of the opinion of g2 as η̄1→2,1 = [0.4, 0.6], η̄3→2,1 = [0.5, 0.8], and η̄5→2,1 = [0.6, 0.9]. The collective adjustment
suggestion is hence ηˆ 2,1 = [0.526, 0.809]. The mechanism for managing non-cooperative behaviors proceeds as follows.

a) Identiﬁcation of non-cooperative behaviors: because τ 2,1 = 0.872 > 0, cluster g2 can be regarded as a non-cooperative subgroup.

b) Interaction and discussion: Cluster g2 changes its adjustment coeﬃcient to z η̄4,1 = [0.3, 0.55].
c) Proper modiﬁcation. The rationality degree is computed as z T 2,1 = 0.048. Thus, the conﬁdence level is ς 2,1 = 0.047. Suppose that χ 1 = 1. The weight of cluster g2 is modiﬁed to z λ2,2 = χ 1 · ς 2,1 · λ2,1 = 0.03 using Eq. (9). The weight vector
of the clusters is updated to λ2 = (0.163, 0.03, 0.417, 0.417)T . Eq. (11) is used to modify the matrix of cluster g2 . The

The derived ranking of alternatives is x2 x3 x4 x1 , and thus x2 is the best alternative. Hence, plastic sheeting is the
most desirable material for constructing emergency shelters.
5. Comparative analysis
This section comprises ﬁve parts. We analyze the effect of the proposed model on managing non-cooperative behaviors.
In Section 5.2, we formulate the inﬂuence of different consensus thresholds on the CRP. In Section 5.3, we present a comparison of the proposed model with other models [34,41]. We discuss the comparison results for different consensus measures
and parameters in Sections 5.4 and 5.5, respectively. Note that the data used in the comparative analysis come from the
case study in Section 4.
5.1. Effect of the conﬁdence consensus-based model on managing non-cooperative behaviors
In the ﬁrst iteration of the case study, cluster g4 was regarded as a completely non-cooperative subgroup. In addition,

τ 4,0 = 1 indicated that the given adjustment coeﬃcient could not satisfy the minimum requirement of the collective ad-

justment suggestion. After an interaction with the other clusters, cluster g4 was still very reluctant to modify its opinion to
improve consensus (i.e., z τ 4,0 = 1). Hence, the DM in cluster g4 was advised to exit the decision process. We can see that
the group consensus level clearly increased from GC I0 = 0.710 to GC I1 = 0.720 after the DM in cluster g4 exited the decision.
This shows that a cluster who has very large difference of opinion from the group and is not willing to modify its opinion
should be advised to exit the decision process in a timely manner. This is useful for enabling the remaining DMs to reach
an agreement quickly.
In the second iteration, cluster g2 was regarded as a partially non-cooperative subgroup. Using weight penalties and
2,1
2,2
opinion adjustment, the individual consensus level was increased from CICM−I
= 0.677 to CICM−I
= 0.807, and eventually the
group consensus level reached the consensus threshold. This suggests that to reduce the weight and modify an opinion
that is substantially different from the group opinion, it is useful to reduce the differences among the DMs and reach an
agreement.
5.2. Analysis of different consensus thresholds
In the following, we analyze the effect of setting different consensus thresholds. Table 2 and Fig. 3 present the decision
results for different consensus thresholds. Fig. 3 shows the number of iterations and group consensus levels. Table 2 lists
the ﬁnal group decision matrices, overall evaluation values of each alternative, and alternative rankings. To better reﬂect
the impact of different consensus thresholds on the decision, in this section, we adopt the objective adjustment coeﬃcient
presented in [34] to simulate the CRP and do not consider non-cooperative behaviors.
Based on the results in Table 2 and Fig. 3, the following observations can be obtained.
(1) The number of iterations decreases as the consensus threshold decreases, and the ﬁnal alternative rankings do not
change. No change in alternative rankings can happen because the attribute weights are ﬁxed.
(2) The ﬁnal rankings are the same; however, the ﬁnal group decision matrices and overall evaluation values of the
alternatives are different.
(3) As the number of iterations increases, the group consensus level eventually meets the threshold.
(4) The closer the group consensus level to the consensus threshold, the lower the opinion adjustment amount.

Appendix B.

(5) A higher consensus threshold requires a greater adjustment amount, which leads to a more likely distortion of opinions. Therefore, the threshold needs to be set reasonably.
(6) An available method to conﬁrm the two important parameters (i.e., the number of iterations and acceptable consensus
threshold) is to simulate the CRP using the objective adjustment coeﬃcient presented in [34]. The simulation results
demonstrate the relationship between the number of iterations and consensus threshold, which can be used as a
reference to determine these two parameters.
5.3. Comparison with Xu et al.’s model [34] and Zhang et al.’s model [41]
To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, a comparative analysis is conducted using another technique
[34]. Xu et al. [34] utilized the degree of non-cooperation to manage non-cooperative behaviors. In our study, the proposed

consensus model includes not only the degree of non-cooperation but also the newly deﬁned degree rationality. We compare
these two models in the second iteration of the case study in Section 4.
The results in Table 3 show the following differences between our proposed model and Xu et al.’s model [34]:
(1) The updated group consensus levels obtained by the two models both exceed the consensus threshold. This ﬁnding
implies that both models are effective at promoting consensus by managing non-cooperative behaviors.
(2) The modiﬁed weights are obviously different. This is for two reasons: (a) The two models calculate the collective adjustment suggestions differently. Xu et al.’s model uses the max-min operator to combine the objective adjustment
coeﬃcient and adjustment suggestions, whereas the proposed model directly aggregates the adjustment suggestions.
This causes the different results for the non-cooperation. (b) The proposed model introduces the rationality and conﬁdence level, which not only considers the non-cooperation of the adjustment but, more importantly, the rationality
of the adjustment coeﬃcient.
(3) The proposed model adds the interaction step and a discussion that could help DMs to provide more favorable adjustment coeﬃcients as well as reducing the distrust and emotional expression of DMs.
Further considering the reasons for the existence of non-cooperative behaviors in the CRP, we recognize that the varying
levels of DMs’ satisfaction with respect to the consensus level can lead to non-cooperative behaviors. For example, in a
CRP under a GDM environment, the DM Andy is asked to adjust his opinion to promote consensus. Suppose that Andy’s
consensus level is 0.7, the group consensus level is 0.75, and the consensus threshold is set as 0.8. Andy thinks his consensus
level is close to the threshold; that is, he is somewhat satisﬁed with this level and hence is unwilling to make a noticeable
adjustment to his opinion. Other DMs, however, do not agree with Andy’s satisfaction regarding the consensus level, and
view Andy’s adjustment action as a non-cooperative behavior. Zhang et al. [41] investigated the individual satisfaction with
consensus level under a heterogeneous LSGDM environment. To better demonstrate the contribution of our proposed model
to managing consensus in LSGDM, we compare Zhang et al.’s model and our proposed model (Table 4).
A detailed explanation of each of these differences are presented below.
5.3.1. Explicit satisfaction versus implicit satisfaction
“Explicit satisfaction” refers to a scenario in which DMs provide their own satisfaction with the consensus level. In Zhang
et al.’s research [41], the collective satisfaction index is obtained by aggregating the individual satisfactions. This collective
satisfaction is compared with the established satisfaction index to determine whether a feedback mechanism is needed. An
implicit expression of satisfaction is thought to be a clue to non-cooperative behaviors. Generally, non-cooperative behaviors
occur for three reasons: (1) a DM (or cluster) thinks the current level of consensus is high enough (that is, he/she is satisﬁed
with the current level of consensus), so there is no need to adjust the preference signiﬁcantly; (2) a DM (or cluster) sticks
to his/her own preferences and is reluctant to adjust them; and (3) a mixture of the ﬁrst two reasons.
The implicit expression of satisfaction is hard to measure. An explicit expression can intuitively quantify a DM’s satisfaction with the consensus level. Unlike our model, Zhang et al.’s model [41] adds a “satisfaction measure” to the CRP. However,
dishonesty may exist and affect the accuracy of such expressions. For example, a non-cooperative DM can avoid being forced

to adjust his/her opinion by falsely reporting a high level of satisfaction. In this sense, dishonesty and non-cooperative behaviors are two issues that must be addressed. Our model proposes a mechanism for managing non-cooperative behaviors
that could be extended to consensus building where satisfaction is expressed explicitly.
5.3.2. The management of non-cooperative behaviors
In LSGDM problems, non-cooperative behaviors always exist [10,20,34]. For example, some individuals may refuse to
modify their preferences or move their preferences to resist consensus to further their private interests. Hence, adding the
management of non-cooperative behaviors to the CRP is necessary in many decision scenarios. Compared with Zhang et al.’
model [41], our proposed model presents a conﬁdence-consensus model that contains a novel mechanism for addressing
non-cooperative behaviors.
5.3.3. Changeable cluster structure versus unalterable cluster structure
Generally, the cluster structure is one of two types: (1) it does not change once it has been determined [34,35] because
a stable clustering structure prompts the members in each subgroup to establish trust feelings and form a uniﬁed opinion
and (2) it changes with the dynamic changes in similarity of DM preferences caused by preference adjustment (see [32,41]).
This study uses the cluster as a basic unit once the clustering structure has been determined.
Additionally, in Zhang et al.’s research [41], when the collective satisfaction degree is lower than the predeﬁned threshold,
all the DMs modify their own preferences. In our model, only the preference of the cluster that is the most different from the
group preference should be modiﬁed. If multiple DMs adjust their preferences simultaneously, the decision-making process
may quickly reach a consensus level with high satisfaction, but it could also become more complex and uncertain.
5.4. Comparison with different consensus measures
In terms of the consensus measure, CM-II is much stricter than CM-I. Because it uses a minimum operator, which is a
more rigorous criterion, its use can avoid the situation in which some clusters’ consensus levels are still lower than the
consensus threshold even though the group consensus level is suﬃciently high in the ﬁnal decision results. In contrast
to CM-I and CM-II, CM-III directly measures the difference between clusters and can avoid the deviation caused by the
weighted average operation when aggregating cluster opinions. Table 5 and Fig. 4 both describe the CRP and results of
using the objective adjustment coeﬃcient to simulate the consensus process for different consensus measures.
Clearly, there are differences in the adjustment amount, ﬁnal decision matrix, ﬁnal alternative evaluation value, and
number of iterations when different consensus measures are used. Based on the simulation results in Table 6 and Fig. 4, we
conclude the following.
(1) CM-II and CM-III have more stringent requirements than CM-I. Different consensus measures may apply to different
decision problems.
(2) Given the differences in consensus measures, different consensus thresholds should be set for the three measures.
In the case study presented in Section 4, the DMs believed that the construction of emergency shelters was the most
important part of post-earthquake recovery and the most appropriate solution was to follow the majority of opinion. Therefore, the DMs with relatively large weights should have a signiﬁcant impact on the group opinion and consensus measure.
Moreover, just as importantly, because of the timeliness of constructing emergency shelters, it is preferable that the solution
be acceptable to most DMs, rather than recognizing all opinions. Eventually, the DMs decided to use CM-I to measure the
consensus levels.

Consensus measure rules

Detailed description

CM-I

Advantages:
• The DMs with relatively large weights have a signiﬁcant impact on the consensus measure. The greater the weight
of a DM, the greater the contribution of its opinion to the group opinion, and thus the higher its individual
consensus level.
• Only the average value of individual consensus levels needs to be higher than the predeﬁned consensus threshold
without all individual consensus levels reaching the threshold. It may not need too many iterations and the
consensus process may not be diﬃcult to implement.
Disadvantages:
• DMs’ weights need to be calculated in advance.
• The consensus process is generally aimed at the lower-weight DMs’ opinions because their opinions contribute less
to the aggregated group opinion and thus are relatively far from the group opinion.
• A compromise appears between some DMs’ opinions with very high consensus levels and those with low consensus
levels when the group consensus level is suﬃciently high.
Advantages:
• DMs with relatively large weights have obvious advantages.
• Using a min operator to calculate consensus allows for a more rigorous criterion that can avoid the compromise
presented in CM-I rule.
Disadvantages:
A tighter measure rule leads to more iterations and a greater adjustment of opinions when the consensus threshold is
ﬁxed.
Advantages:
There is no need to consider the weights of DMs when measuring the consensus. All the concerns regard calculating
the differences between DM’s opinions.
Disadvantages:
The advantages of DMs with relatively large weights cannot be effectively embodied in a consensus measure.

5.5. Comparison with different parameters
In this part, we analyze the inﬂuence of parameters μWG , ν WG , and χ t on the decision results. Considering the ﬁrst
iteration in the case study, Table 7 and Fig. 5 show the simulation results when different input parameters μWG , ν WG , and
χ 1 are set. The simulation results in Table 7 use ﬁve sets of μWG and ν WG and three sets of χ 1 and illustrate the change
in the conﬁdence level, group consensus level, and adjusted weight. Fig. 5 shows the results when we randomly generated
input parameters μWG , ν WG , and χ 1 and run the simulation 1,0 0 0 times to obtain the conﬁdence level and adjusted weight
values. To compare the data more intuitively, we present four signiﬁcant ﬁgures for the weights z λ2, 2 and updated group
consensus levels in Table 7 and Fig. 5.
The following observations are obtained.
(1) Let the auxiliary coeﬃcient χ 1 be ﬁxed. When setting different parameters μWG and ν WG , there are differences in
the conﬁdence level, adjusted weight, and updated group consensus level. For example, in Table 7, for χ 1 = 5, when

Notes: (a) The data in the item “Updated alternative ranking” represent three groups of alternative rankings when parameter
χ 1 is set to 5, 2 and 1, respectively. “2341” indicates that the alternative ranking is x2 x3 x4 x1 .
(b) The data in the item “Updated group consensus level” represent the different group consensus levels when parameter
χ 1 is set to 5, 2, and 1, respectively.

Fig. 5. Simulation results of conﬁdence level ς 2, 1 and adjusted weight z λ2, 2 for different parameters μWG , ν WG , and χ 1 .

μWG = 0 and νWG = 1, the updated group consensus level is 0.7511 and z λ2,2 = 0.0405; when μWG = 0.7 and νWG =
0.3, the group consensus level is 0.7509 and z λ2,2 = 0.0368. Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows our comparison of the two
sets of coordinates, that is, the pair (0.1, 6.6, 0.144) and (0.8, 6.6, 0.131) and the pair (0.1, 6.6, 0.0526) and (0.8, 6.6,
0.0479). The difference in the conﬁdence level and adjusted weight is obvious.
(2) Let μWG and ν WG be ﬁxed. When χ 1 is set to different values, then the adjusted weight of cluster g2 may also be
different. For example, in Table 7, when μ = 0.3, ν = 0.7, andχ 1 is set to 5 or 2, the corresponding adjusted weight
of g2 is 0.0388 or 0.0155. In accordance with Eq. (9), when the conﬁdence level is ﬁxed, the adjusted weight is
proportional to parameter χ 1 . The two coordinates shown in Fig. 5, i.e., (0.1, 6.6, 0.0526) and (0.1, 4.1, 0.0327), also
demonstrate this proportional relation.
6. Conclusions
Because LSGDM can model many real-world decisions, a conﬁdence consensus-based model that considers noncooperative behaviors was proposed. The major contributions of this study are as follows:
New concepts were proposed: the collective adjustment suggestion, degree of rationality, and conﬁdence level.
A novel mechanism for addressing non-cooperative behaviors was presented. We divide the management of noncooperative behaviors into three phases. The interaction and discussion effectively make DMs provide more suitable
adjustment coeﬃcients. In this process, we combine the degrees of rationality and non-cooperation to construct the
conﬁdence level of a cluster’s adjustment coeﬃcient. It is more accurate and objective to use the conﬁdence level to
measure the willingness of a cluster to adjust its opinion to promote agreement. Further, it ensures that the cluster has
an accurate and reasonable understanding of the decision problem.
• An algorithm for the conﬁdence consensus-based model in LSGDM was presented. Its aim is to better address noncooperative behaviors and obtain a common decision result with a suﬃciently high level of group consensus.
•

We summarized different consensus measures and used simulation to compare them. The simulation results reveal the
advantages and disadvantages of these different measures.
• A comparison with Zhang et al.’s model [41] leads to the concepts of “explicit satisfaction” and “implicit satisfaction.”
These concepts lead to a signiﬁcant research issue: how to measure satisfaction that is implicitly expressed.
•

Meanwhile, there still exist some limitations:
(1) In some real-life LSGDM, trust relationships among DMs deﬁned by a social network play a key role. As a consequence, the research on CRMs in social network-based GDM has been paid increasing attention. It could be meaningful to build an improved CRM for addressing non-cooperative behaviors within a social network environment.
(2) Zhang et al.’s research [41] indicates that in a LSGDM, DMs often have individual concerns about alternatives and
satisfactions regarding the degree of consensus in CRPs. Thus, they prefer to use heterogeneous preference representation structures to express their opinions. It is important to extend the traditional CRMs to manage non-cooperative
behaviors in heterogeneous LSGDM with individual concerns and satisfactions.
(3) How to more reasonably modify DMs’ weights based on the conﬁdence level is also an important issue to address.
Solving this matter depends on multiple simulation analyses with real data from different sources.
