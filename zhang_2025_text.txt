weights of experts and subgroups are obtained based on the internal influence of experts
and the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy of subgroup preferences. Further, considering three dif-
ferent strategies of human-AI interaction, subgroup consensus and subgroup-AI consensus
are calculated. Finally, a minimum cost consensus model with heterogeneous feedback strat-
egies is proposed. The usability of the proposed model is verified through a medical diagno-
sis case. This study found that the human-AI coordination with heterogeneous feedback
strategies can reduce adjustment costs, and different interaction mechanisms have different
effects.
